Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 5, 2023, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Euro-denominated credit agreement (the “Euro Credit Agreement”) among the Company, the lender(s) party thereto and ING Bank, N.V., London Branch, as Agent. Under the Euro Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to €1,300,000,000, including €300,000,000 of incremental commitment, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Any Loan (as defined in the Euro Credit Agreement) will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable EURIBOR rate (adjusted for any statutory reserves) plus 0.75% for the interest period selected by the Company of one, three or six months; once repaid, in full or in part, a Loan may not be re-borrowed. Accrued and unpaid interest is payable at the end of the applicable interest period selected by the Company, but no less frequently than every three months. The Euro Credit Agreement terminates and all amounts outstanding thereunder are payable on May 3, 2024 (the “Termination Date”); provided, however, that the Company may extend the Termination Date by six months on up to two occasions.
The Euro Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens and merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Euro Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1.
The foregoing description of the Euro Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Euro Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10(a) and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant
On May 9, 2023, the Company submitted irrevocable notices to borrow €1,300,000,000 under the Euro Credit Agreement. The Company expects to use amounts borrowed under the Euro Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of outstanding debt.

3


of such Benchmark exists, in such other manner of administration as the Agent decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).

(2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided, that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (3) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.
For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or
(3) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof)

If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 13.2
, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.
Section 2.21
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)
;
(b)
any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Section 8.4
or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 12.1
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder;
second
, as the Borrower may request (so long as no
25


Unmatured Default or Default exists), to the funding of the Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;
third
, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to the Loan under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document;
fifth
, so long as no Unmatured Default or Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and
sixth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of the Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) the Loan was made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.3
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loan of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of the Loan of such Defaulting Lender until such time as the Loan is funded. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; and
(c)
the Commitment and principal amount of the outstanding Loan of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.2
);
provided
, that this
clause (c)
shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby.
The Agent shall provide written notice to any Lender determined by the Agent to be a Defaulting Lender hereunder (and the Agent shall provide a copy of such determination to the Borrower). In the event that the Agent and the Borrower agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, if the Loan is outstanding on such date, such Lender shall purchase, at par plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, a portion of the Loan of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold a proportion of the Loan in accordance with its applicable Commitment percentage.
ARTICLE III
YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
Section 3.1
Yield Protection
. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law:
(a)
subjects any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b)
through
(d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or
(b)
imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to the Loan), or
26


(c)
imposes any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining the Loan or reduces any amount receivable by any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with the Loan, or requires any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of the Loan held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Recipient,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining the Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make the Loan) or to reduce the return received by such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation in connection with the Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make the Loan), then, within 15 days of demand by such Recipient, the Borrower shall pay such Recipient such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Recipient for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
Section 3.2
Increased Costs.
3.2.1
If any Change in Law shall:
(a)
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate);
(b)
impose on any Lender or the applicable interbank market for Euros any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the Loan; or
subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, or such other Recipient of making, continuing, converting or maintaining the Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make the Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that as to any Lender seeking compensation under this Section 3.2.1, such Lender shall only be compensated to the extent such Lender is then generally seeking compensation from similarly situated customers under agreements related to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 3.2.1 and the definition of “Change in Law.”
3.2.2
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loan, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital
27


adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
3.2.3
A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
3.2.4
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 3.3
Illegality
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund the Loan whose interest is determined by reference to the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or to determine or charge interest based upon the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Agent) (an “
Illegality Notice
”), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make the Loan shall be suspended until each affected Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert the reference used to determine the interest on the Loan from Adjusted EURIBOR Rate to the Central Bank Rate on the last day of each applicable Interest Period therefor (if applicable), if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain the Loan to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain the Loan to such day, in each case until the Agent is advised in writing by each affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.4.
Section 3.4
Funding Indemnification
. If any payment of the Loan occurs on a date which is not the last day of an applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or the Loan is not made on the date requested by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any actual, out-of-pocket loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any actual loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Loan.
Section 3.5
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the
28


applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.5
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
(c)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this
, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
(d)
Indemnification by the Borrower
. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 13.2.4
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this
paragraph (e)
.
(f)
Status of Lenders

Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the
29


Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
ii.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), an executed copy of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;

30


4)
to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)
if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D)
, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
iii.

31


(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this
Section 3.5
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this
Section 3.5(g)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)
Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitment and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.
Section 3.6
Mitigation of Additional Costs or Adverse Circumstances
. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in an increase in the liability of the Borrower to such Lender under
Section 3.1
,
3.2
3.3
or
3.5
; or the unavailability of a Benchmark under
Section 2.9.2
; then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the Borrower’s obligations under any of the clauses referred to above in this
, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to its own position, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, (i) the transfer of its Loan to a Lending Installation in another jurisdiction, (ii) the assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity willing to participate in this facility or (iii) the restructure of its participation in this facility in a manner which will avoid the event in question and on terms mutually acceptable to such Lender, the Agent and the Borrower). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, or if any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, such Lender shall be obliged, at the written request of the Borrower, to assign all its rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.1
and
) and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity nominated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender;
provided
that such other bank or entity satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by
Sections 3.5(f)
13.3.3
. Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Borrower under
10.6
shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender.
Section 3.7
Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Loan to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under
3.2,
or to avoid the unavailability of a Benchmark under
, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written
32


statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
Section 3.1
,
3.2
3.4
or
3.5
. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with the Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded the Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not;
provided
, that such Lender need not disclose any information that is confidential or to the extent prohibited by law or regulation. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under
Sections 3.1
3.3
and
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Article III
, the Borrower shall not be required to make any payments to any Lender pursuant to
with respect to periods of time more than 90 days prior to the date upon which such Lender’s written statement in accordance with the terms of this
Section 3.7
is first delivered to the Borrower.

Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs
. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for hedging agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “
QFC Credit Support

Supported QFC
”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “
U.S. Special Resolution Regimes
”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “
Covered Party
”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Unmatured Default or Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent.

Article XI
and
Article X

51


their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.

provided
that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to
Section 3.5(g)
shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
The Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower;
that such resignation shall be subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, unless the Initial Lender is the sole Lender hereunder. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, or Sweden, or an Affiliate of any such bank.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.6
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

52


material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder.

Section 13.2.2
and (c) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of

EXHIBIT A
FORM OF IN-HOUSE OPINION
May 5, 2023
The Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the
Credit Agreement described below.
I am Chief Governance Counsel for Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “
Borrower
”), and have represented the Borrower in connection with its execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement among the Borrower, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, as Agent, and the Lenders named therein, providing for a Loan in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding, as of the date hereof, €1,000,000,000 at any one time outstanding and dated as of May 5, 2023 (the “
Credit
Agreement
”). All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.
I have examined the Borrower’s certificate of incorporation, by-laws, resolutions, the Loan Documents (for purposes of this opinion, “Loan Documents” shall mean the Credit Agreement and any promissory notes issued thereunder) and such other matters of fact and law which I deem necessary in order to render this opinion. I have relied on the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement with respect to the factual matters set forth therein. Based upon the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1.
The Borrower is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, except where the failure to have such authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Loan Documents.
2.
The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower and the performance by the Borrower of the Obligations have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Borrower and will not:
(a)
require any consent of the Borrower’s shareholders;
(b)
violate the Subject Law (as defined below), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or the Borrower’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or by-laws or, to my knowledge, any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Borrower; or
(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien pursuant to the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement known to me and binding upon the
Borrower which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
3.
The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower.
Exhibit A-1


		



4.
There is no litigation or proceeding against the Borrower which, to my knowledge, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5.
No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of any Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained by the Borrower, is required to be obtained by the Borrower in connect with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowing under the Credit Agreement or in connection with the payment by the Borrower of the Obligations.
I render no opinion herein as to any provisions of federal or state securities laws and regulations (including laws and regulations administered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission), state “blue sky” laws and regulations, margin regulations (other than compliance with the provisions of Regulation U and Regulation X of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to the making of the Loans as provided in the Credit Agreement), laws and regulations relating to commodity (and other) futures and indices and other similar instruments, federal or state forfeiture laws, any federal or state laws regulating pensions and employee benefits, including, without limitation, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations, federal and state environmental, land use, subdivision and zoning laws and regulations, tax laws and regulations, racketeering (e.g., RICO) laws and regulations, health and safety (e.g., OSHA) and labor laws and regulations, bulk transfer laws and patent, copyright and trademark laws.
I express no opinion with respect to any matter arising out of or related to the USA Patriot Act of 2001, as amended, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq., The Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. app. 1 et seq., any regulations promulgated under the foregoing laws, Executive Order No. 13224 on Terrorist Financing, any sanctions program administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, or any other laws, regulations, executive orders or government programs designed to combat terrorism or money laundering, or the effect of any of the foregoing laws, regulations, orders or programs, if applicable, to the transaction described in the Credit Agreement.
I am a member of the bar of the State of Washington. Subject to the preceding paragraph, the opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Washington, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (without reference to interpretive case law) and the federal laws of the United States of America normally applicable to transactions of this nature (collectively, the “Subject Law”), and I express no opinion concerning the laws of any other jurisdiction, whether applicable directly or through Washington law. I express no opinion concerning any ordinances, administrative decisions, rules or regulations of any county, town, municipality or special political subdivision (whether created or enabled through legislative action at the federal, state or regional level).
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and is not to be circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to or relied upon for any other purposes or by any other person without my prior written consent; provided, however, that any reliance must be actual and reasonable and subject to the understanding that this opinion is rendered as of the date hereof with no reissuance
Exhibit A-2


		



as at any future date, including, without limitation, any date that a successor or assign may become a party to the Credit Agreement and provided, further, that you may furnish this opinion (a) to your potential successors and assignees and to potential participants of your rights under the Credit Agreement, (b) to bank examiners and other regulatory authorities should they so request or in connection with their normal examinations, (c) to your or their respective independent accountants and attorneys, and (d) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency or requirement of applicable law or regulation. This opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated. I expressly disclaim any obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to my attention or changes in the law that may hereafter occur.
