Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
February 2, 2023
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2022 fourth quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and the discrete tax benefit of $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, for comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefit of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and the discrete tax benefit of $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 excluding the net impact of gains from two divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other annual periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, IL., February 2, 2023 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and initiated guidance for full year 2023.
“We delivered a robust finish to a strong year of differentiated execution and performance by the ITW team. Fourth quarter organic growth was 12 percent, operating margin was 24.8 percent, and earnings per share increased 21 percent excluding divestiture gains,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We were very pleased with both our revenue growth and margin performance in the fourth quarter as we delivered eight percent overall revenue growth and a 210-basis point operating margin improvement.”
“For all of 2022, in a year marked by significant supply chain disruptions and cost inflation, ITW delivered organic growth of 12 percent for the second year in a row, operating margin of 24.4 percent in our base business, after tax return on invested capital of 29.1 percent, and record GAAP EPS of $9.77, an increase of 15 percent versus the prior year. There is no question that our decision to stay invested in our enterprise strategy and in our people throughout the pandemic and the quality of our teams’ execution of our “Win the Recovery” focus coming out of it are powering the strong growth and financial performance ITW is currently delivering. As a result, we are very pleased with our momentum and positioning heading into 2023. I want to again thank my ITW colleagues around the world for their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence,” Santi concluded.
Fourth Quarter 2022 Results
Fourth quarter revenue of $4.0 billion increased eight percent with organic revenue growth of 12 percent. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures contributed one percent to revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced revenue by five percent. Five of seven segments delivered double-digit organic growth in the quarter, led by Automotive OEM up 20 percent, Food Equipment up 17 percent, Welding up 15 percent, Polymers & Fluids up 11 percent, and Test & Measurement and Electronics up 10 percent. Construction Products was up four percent, and Specialty Products was up three percent. On a geographic basis, organic growth was 13 percent in North America, 11 percent in Europe, and nine percent in Asia Pacific.
GAAP EPS increased 53 percent to $2.95 and included $0.61 of divestiture gains and $0.12 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Excluding divestiture gains and foreign currency translation impact, EPS of $2.46 increased 27 percent.
Operating income increased 18 percent to $986 million and incremental margin was 52 percent. Operating margin of 24.8 percent improved 210 basis points with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points and favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points. Operating cash flow was $811 million, and free cash flow was $655 million, a seven percent sequential improvement from the third quarter and a conversion rate to net income of 72 percent. Excluding the abovementioned divestiture gains, the conversion rate to net income was 91 percent. The company repurchased $500 million of


its own shares and the effective tax rate was 19.1 percent, which included a 2.9 percentage-point favorable impact from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards related to the divestitures.
Full Year 2022 Results
Full year revenue of $15.9 billion increased 10 percent with organic revenue growth of 12 percent. The net impact from acquisitions and divestitures contributed two percent to revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced revenue by four percent. Five of seven segments delivered double-digit organic growth for the year, led by Food Equipment up 23 percent, Welding up 16 percent, Construction Products up 14 percent, Automotive OEM up 12 percent, and Polymers & Fluids up 11 percent. Test & Measurement and Electronics was up nine percent and Specialty Products was up 0.4 percent. On a geographic basis, organic growth was 14 percent in North America, 10 percent in Europe, and eight percent in Asia Pacific.
GAAP EPS increased 15 percent to $9.77 including the abovementioned divestiture gains and $0.39 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Excluding divestiture gains and foreign currency translation impact, EPS increased 12 percent. Operating margin of 23.8 percent declined 30 basis points primarily due to 150 basis points of combined unfavorable margin headwind from price/cost and MTS acquisition impact. Operating cash flow was $2.3 billion and free cash flow was $1.9 billion with a conversion rate of 64 percent to net income, as the company continues to make working capital investments to support double-digit organic revenue growth and to mitigate supply chain risk in order to sustain best-in-class customer service levels across our portfolio. The company repurchased $1.75 billion of its own shares, and the effective tax rate was 21 percent.
Fourth Quarter Divestiture Update
As previously announced, on October 3, 2022, ITW closed the sale of a $100 million revenue division within the Polymers & Fluids segment for $220 million. On December 1, 2022, ITW closed the sale of a $35 million revenue business unit within the Food Equipment segment for $59 million. The gains on sale related to these two divestitures contributed $197 million to non-operating income and $0.61 to fourth quarter EPS.
2023 Guidance
The company is initiating 2023 guidance including GAAP EPS in the range of $9.40 to $9.80 per share and organic growth of three to five percent based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in certain end markets. Foreign currency translation and the abovementioned divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by approximately 0.75 percent each, resulting in total revenue growth of 1.5 to 3.5 percent. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 24.5 to 25.5 percent, with approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. Free cash flow is expected to be greater than 100 percent of net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares. The projected effective tax rate is approximately 24 percent.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding the duration and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain challenges, related government actions and the company’s strategy in response thereto on the company’s business, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, diluted income per share, restructuring expenses and related benefits, expected dividend payments, expected repatriation of overseas cash, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected access to liquidity sources, expected capital allocation, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, potential acquisitions and divestitures and related impact on financial results, including statements with respect to the impact of the 2021 acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business and the 2022 divestitures, and the company’s 2023 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Such factors include those contained in ITW's Form 10-K for 2021 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
