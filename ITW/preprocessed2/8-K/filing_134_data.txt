Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
May 2, 2023
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2023 first quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 excluding the net impact of gains from two divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other annual periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Document
Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports First Quarter 2023 Results
•
Revenue of $4.0 billion, an increase of 2% with organic growth of 5%
Operating income of $972 million, an increase of 9%
Operating margin of 24.2%, an increase of 150 bps
GAAP EPS of $2.33, an increase of 10%
Raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $9.45 to $9.85 per share
GLENVIEW, IL., May 2, 2023 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first quarter 2023 results.
“The ITW team delivered a solid start to the year with organic growth of five percent, operating margin expansion of 150 basis points, strong free cash flow, and double-digit EPS growth as we continue to demonstrate the performance power of our proprietary business model and the resilience of our diversified high-quality business portfolio,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “While the near-term economic outlook continues to be uncertain, I am confident that ITW remains well positioned to deliver best-in-class performance in any environment.”
First Quarter 2023 Results
First quarter revenue of $4.0 billion increased two percent with organic revenue growth of five percent. Foreign currency translation impact and divestitures combined reduced revenue by three percent.
GAAP EPS increased 10 percent to $2.33, a new first quarter record, and included $0.06 of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Operating income increased nine percent to $972 million. Operating margin of 24.2 percent improved 150 basis points with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points. Operating cash flow was $728 million, and free cash flow was $615 million, an increase of 147 percent, with a conversion rate to net income of 86 percent. The company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and the effective tax rate was 22.6 percent.
2023 Guidance
The company is raising its full-year GAAP EPS guidance to $9.45 to $9.85 per share which incorporates a projected lower tax rate for the full year in the range of 23.5 to 24 percent. This compares to previous guidance of $9.40 to $9.80 per share. The organic growth projection of three to five percent reflects current levels of demand and a risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. Foreign currency translation impact and divestitures combined are expected to reduce revenue by one percent, resulting in total revenue growth of two to four percent. This compares to previous guidance of 1.5 to 3.5 percent. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 24.5 to 25.5 percent, with approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. Free cash flow is projected to be greater than 100 percent of net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding global supply chain challenges, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, statements regarding diluted income per share, restructuring expenses and related benefits, expected dividend payments, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected access to liquidity sources, expected capital allocation, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, the impact of recent or potential acquisitions and/or divestitures, and the Company’s 2023 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Such factors include those contained in ITW's Form 10-K for 2022.
