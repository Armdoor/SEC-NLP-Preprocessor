Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
August 2, 2022
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2022 second quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, for comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefit of $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and the discrete tax benefit of $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Total revenue of $4.0 billion; organic growth of 10%
GAAP EPS of $2.37 included $(0.15) of EPS headwind from foreign currency translation impact and higher restructuring expenses
Operating margin of 23.1% included 200 bps of operating leverage offset by (160) bps of price/cost impact and (100) bps of headwind from the MTS acquisition and higher restructuring expenses
Maintaining full-year 2022 guidance including organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% and record GAAP EPS of $9.00 to $9.40 per share
GLENVIEW, IL., August 2, 2022 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its second quarter 2022 results.
“In the current environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of demonstrating the power and resilience of the ITW Business Model as evidenced by the more than 10 percent organic growth and 23 percent plus operating margin that they delivered in the second quarter,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Across the company we continue to leverage our 80/20 front-to-back driven operational capabilities to support our customers and execute our “Win the Recovery” strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. Looking ahead at the remainder of 2022, based on our first half results and current levels of demand, we are maintaining our current guidance for full-year 2022, including organic growth of 8.5 percent and record GAAP EPS of $9.20 at their respective mid-points. While the near-term environment has its challenges, we remain focused on delivering differentiated service to our customers, top-tier financial performance for our shareholders, and continued progress on our path to ITW’s full potential performance.”
Second Quarter 2022 Results
Second quarter revenue of $4.0 billion increased nine percent with organic revenue growth of 10 percent. The acquisition of MTS contributed three percent to revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced revenue by four percent. Six of seven segments delivered positive organic growth in the quarter, led by Food Equipment up 25 percent, Welding up 22 percent, Construction Products up 15 percent, Polymers & Fluids up 10 percent, Automotive OEM up six percent, and Test & Measurement and Electronics up one percent due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Specialty Products organic revenue was down less than two percent. On a geographic basis, organic growth was 14 percent in North America, 6 percent in Europe, and 3 percent in Asia Pacific.
GAAP EPS was $2.37 and included $(0.05) of higher restructuring expenses related to 80/20 front-to-back projects, $(0.10) of unfavorable foreign currency translation, and a $0.16 one-time tax benefit related to the routine resolution of a U.S. tax audit. As a reminder, GAAP EPS of $2.45 in the second quarter of 2021 included a $0.35 one-time tax benefit. Operating margin was 24.1 percent excluding margin dilution impacts of (50) basis points each from the MTS acquisition and higher restructuring expenses. Enterprise initiatives contributed 90 basis points. Price/cost margin dilution impact moderated in the second quarter to (160) basis points compared to (250) basis points in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow was $501 million, and free cash flow was $420 million with a conversion rate of 57 percent. The reported tax rate for the second quarter was 18.3 percent and excluding the one-time tax benefit, the effective tax rate was 23.9 percent.
2022 Guidance
ITW is maintaining its full-year GAAP EPS guidance of $9.00 to $9.40 per share. Based on current levels of demand, the company is projecting full-year revenue growth in the range of six to nine percent, with organic growth of seven to ten percent. At current foreign exchange rates, currency translation is projected to reduce revenue by four percent and EPS by approximately $(0.35). The acquisition of MTS is expected to add three percent to revenue. Operating margin is forecasted to be in the range of 24 to 25 percent, with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately 100 basis points and price/cost margin dilution impact of (100) basis points. Price is projected to exceed input cost inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The expected free cash flow conversion rate is unchanged at 85 to 95 percent of net income, and the company is on pace to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares. The projected effective tax rate is 22 to 23 percent.


Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding the duration and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain challenges, related government actions and the company’s strategy in response thereto on the company’s business, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation, enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, diluted income per share, restructuring expenses and related benefits, expected dividend payments, expected repatriation of overseas cash, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected access to liquidity sources, expected capital allocation, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, potential acquisitions and divestitures and related impact on financial results, including statements with respect to the impact of the 2021 acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, and the company’s 2022 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Such factors include those contained in ITW's Form 10-K for 2021 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
