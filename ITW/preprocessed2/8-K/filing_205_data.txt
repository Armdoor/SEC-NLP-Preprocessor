Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
May 3, 2022
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its 2022 first quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and the discrete tax benefit of $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefits of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2021. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other annual periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports First Quarter 2022 Results
•
Total revenue of $3.9 billion; organic growth of 11%
GAAP EPS of $2.11 including $(0.05) of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact
Operating margin of 22.7%; 23.4% excluding 70 bps of margin dilution from the acquisition of MTS
Raising guidance for GAAP EPS to $9.00 to $9.40 per share and organic revenue growth to 7 to 10%
GLENVIEW, IL., May 3, 2022 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first quarter 2022 results.
“In what remains a challenging and dynamic environment, our ITW business teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of leveraging the performance power of the ITW Business Model and our advantaged supply position to support our customers and execute our ‘Win the Recovery’ strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our first quarter results reflect continued strong momentum in this regard, and we remain well-positioned to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenges that lie ahead as we move through the balance of 2022.”
First Quarter 2022 Results
First quarter revenue grew 11.2 percent to $3.9 billion with organic growth of 10.6 percent. The acquisition of MTS contributed 2.8 percent to revenue. Foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 2.2 percent. Six of seven segments delivered positive organic growth, led by Food Equipment up 28 percent, Construction Products up 21 percent, Welding and Polymers & Fluids both up 13 percent, Test & Measurement and Electronics up eight percent, and Specialty Products up one percent. Organic revenue was down one percent in Automotive OEM due to automotive production limitations related to component supply shortages.
GAAP EPS was $2.11, including $(0.05) of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Operating margin was 23.4 percent, excluding 70 basis points of margin dilution impact from the acquisition of MTS. Enterprise initiatives contributed 90 basis points. While pricing actions more than offset raw material cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the impact of price/cost reduced margin percentage by 250 basis points. Operating cash flow was $323 million, and free cash flow was $249 million with a conversion of 38 percent of net income due to higher working capital investments to support double digit revenue growth and increased inventory levels to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain customer service levels. The company repurchased $375 million of its own shares, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.1 percent.
2022 Guidance
Based on the company’s first quarter results and projecting current levels of demand through the balance of the year, ITW is raising its full-year organic growth guidance to seven to 10 percent and full-year revenue growth guidance to 8.5 to 11.5 percent. The acquisition of MTS is expected to add three percent to revenue. Foreign currency translation is expected to reduce revenue by 1.5 percent. The company is also raising its full-year GAAP EPS guidance to $9.00 to $9.40 per share, an increase of 11 to 16 percent versus prior year excluding the impact of favorable one-time tax items in 2021. Operating margin is expected to expand to 24 to 25 percent, with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points. The margin dilution impact from the acquisition of MTS and price/cost are expected to be 50 and 100 basis points, respectively. Free cash flow is expected to grow 10 to 20 percent year-over-year with a conversion rate of 85 to 95 percent of net income. The company is on pace to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares, and the effective tax rate is expected to be 23 to 24 percent.
