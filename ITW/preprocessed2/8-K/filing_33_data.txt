,
however
, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary, the period in this clause (C) shall commence on the later of (x) the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the next annual meeting and (y) the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of the next annual meeting is first made by the corporation;
3


(D)
the Special Meeting Request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or other applicable law; or
(E)
any Requesting Stockholder violated the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
(iii)

SECTION 3.
Place of Meeting
.

Shares of stock standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares of stock held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so to do be contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.
SECTION 6.
Fixing of Record Date
. Unless any statute requires otherwise, for the purpose of determining (a) stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or (b) stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or (c) stockholders, with respect to any lawful action, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders, such date in any case to be not more than sixty (60) days before such meeting of stockholders, payment or action, as applicable, and, in case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten (10) days before such meeting of stockholders and, in the case of a merger, consolidation, sale, lease or exchange of assets, not less than twenty (20) days before the date of such merger, consolidation, sale, lease or exchange of assets. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
5


day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided
,
however
, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these by-laws. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present or represented. No notice other than an announcement at the meeting need be given unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days or a new record date is to be fixed for the adjourned meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these by-laws, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
SECTION 8.
Proxies
. At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing or via electronic transmission by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. Proxies shall be valid only with respect to the meeting or meetings, and any adjournment thereof, for which they are given.
SECTION 9.
Voting
. Each stockholder shall have one vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock having voting power registered in his name on the books of the corporation at the record date.

6


(a)
Annual Meetings of Stockholders
.
(1) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who (x) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving notice provided for in this section 10 and at the time of the annual meeting of stockholders, (y) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (z) complies with the notice procedures as to such business or nomination set forth in this section 10. Clause (iii) of this paragraph shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than matters properly brought under section 12 of these by-laws or Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the corporation's notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of stockholders.
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 10, such other business must be a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware corporation law, and the stockholder must have given timely notice of such nomination or other business, in proper form, in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day and not later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. A stockholder’s notice must be timely updated and supplemented, if necessary, by delivery to the secretary of the corporation (i) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (ii) no later than the fifth (5th) day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit a stockholder to change or add any proposed director nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including, without limitation, under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any defect. If a stockholder intends to solicit proxies for the election of directors other
7


than the nominees of the board of directors (or a committee thereof) in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, such stockholder must comply with the timing requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) of section 10 for the notice to be timely. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
The number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the annual meeting (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of a beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of directors to be elected at such annual meeting.
To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must set forth:
(i) the following as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or business proposal is made (each a “Proposing Person”):
(A) the name and address of such Proposing Person and of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them;
(B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such Proposing Person and their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them, as of the date of such notice (which information shall be supplemented by such Proposing Person not later than ten (10) business days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date);
(C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of such notice by, or on behalf of, such Proposing Person or any of their affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of such Proposing Person or any of their affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, and a representation that such Proposing Person will notify the corporation in writing of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed;
8


(D) a written representation as to whether such stockholder intends, or is part of a group that intends, to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the nominees of the board of directors (or a committee thereof) in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act;
(E) for those stockholders that affirm intent to solicit proxies in accordance with Rule 14a-19 pursuant to the preceding paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section 10, provide an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the board of directors or its designee (which form shall be provided by the corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a stockholder), on behalf of such stockholder and any group of which such stockholder is a member, pursuant to which such stockholder acknowledges and agrees that (1) the corporation shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for such stockholder’s nominees if such stockholder (y) notifies the corporation that such stockholder no longer intends, or is part of a group that no longer intends, to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the nominees of the board of directors (or a committee thereof) in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act or (z) fails to comply with Rules 14a-19(a)(2) and (3) under the Exchange Act (or with the interpretation of such requirements by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to special meetings, if applicable), and (2) if such stockholder provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(a)(1) under the Exchange Act, such stockholder shall deliver to the secretary of the corporation, not later than five (5) business days prior to the applicable meeting, reasonable documentary evidence (as determined by the corporation or one of its representatives in good faith) that the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act have been satisfied; and
(F) any other information relating to such Proposing Person or any of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert therewith that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
(ii) the following if the notice relates to any business other than the nomination of a director that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting:
(A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any
9


material interest of such Proposing Person or of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them, in such business;

(C) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such Proposing Person or any of their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert therewith and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder; and
(iii) the following as to each person whom such Proposing Person proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director:
(A) the name, age, and addresses of such person;
(B) the principal occupation or employment of such person;
(C) the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation beneficially owned by such person;
(D) an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the board of directors or its designee (which form shall be provided by the corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a stockholder) that such person (1) is willing to be named in the proxy statement and form of proxy card of the corporation as a nominee (and will not agree to be named in any other person’s proxy statement or form of proxy card related to the corporation), (2) is qualified and if elected intends to serve as a director of the corporation for the entire term for which such person is standing for election, (3) is not and will not become a party to (y) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a “Voting Commitment”) or (z) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person’s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (4) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding
10


with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director of the corporation;
(E) an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the board of directors or its designee (which form shall be provided by the corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a stockholder) that such person, if elected, intends to adhere to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles of Conduct and any other publicly available policies and guidelines of the corporation applicable to directors (including the procedures established by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting);
(F) such other information regarding such person that would be required to be included under the proxy solicitation rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had the board of directors nominated such nominee;
(G) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the preceding three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among such Proposing Person and their respective affiliates and associates or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, but not limited to, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if such Proposing Person making the nomination or on whose behalf the nomination is made, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(H) completed, signed and submitted copies of all questionnaires, representations and agreements required by these by-laws and of the corporation’s directors generally; and
(I) an undertaking to provide such other information as the corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person.

Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made (i) by the board of directors at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether such special meeting was called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II or section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws), (ii) by stockholders in accordance with the notice and other requirements set forth in section 2(b) of article II of these by-laws at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that was called pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws or (iii) by stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that was called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II of these by-laws,
provided
, that any such stockholder (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section 10 and at the time of the special meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section 10. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations for director before a special meeting of stockholders.
For nominations or proposals to be properly brought by a stockholder at a special meeting called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II of these by-laws, the stockholder must have given timely notice of the nomination or proposal to the secretary of the corporation, and timely updates and supplements thereof, in each case as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section 10. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day before the date of such special meeting and not later than the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the special meeting. If a stockholder intends to solicit proxies for the election of directors other than the nominees of the board of directors (or a committee thereof) in accordance with Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, such stockholder must comply with the timing requirements of this section (b) of section 10 for the notice to be timely. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board of directors, in its discretion, may determine that a stockholder nomination or proposal, even if complying with the notice requirements in this section 10(b), shall not be brought before a special meeting if:
(A)
the proposal relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law;
12


(B)
the proposal or nomination was submitted in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law; or
(C)
the stockholder making the proposal or nomination violated the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
(c)
General
.
(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10, shall be eligible to be elected as directors at a meeting of stockholders, and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10, and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these by-laws, including this section 10, to declare that such proposed nomination or business shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section 10 shall preclude the board of directors or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee from making nominations for the election of directors or proposing business to be transacted at any special meeting of stockholders that is called pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws.
(2) For purposes of this section 10, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the PR Newswire or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Nothing in this section 10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of (i) stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) the holders of any series of preferred stock if and to the extent provided for under law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws.
13


(4) Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for exclusive use by the board of directors.
SECTION 11.
Election of Directors
. Except as provided in article III, section 8 of these by-laws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present;
provided
,
however
, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i)(a) the secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the board of directors in compliance with the requirements set forth in article II, section 10 or article II, section 12, as applicable, of these by-laws or (b) the secretary of the corporation receives a valid Special Meeting Request pursuant to article II, section 2(b) of these by-laws for the election of directors; and (ii) such nomination or Special Meeting Request, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn by such stockholder as of a date that is ten (10) days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented). For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” that director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has established procedures regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting.
SECTION 12.
Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials
.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these by-laws, the corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the “Stockholder Nominee”) to the board of directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders that satisfies the requirements of this section 12, including qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this section 12 (a “Proxy Access Notice”) to have its nominee included in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12. For the purposes of this section 12:
(1) “Voting Stock” shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors;
(2) “Constituent Holder” shall mean any stockholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined below) or beneficial holder whose stock
14


ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined below) or qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below);
(3) “affiliate” and “associate” shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Securities Act;
provided
,
however
, that the term “partner” as used in the definition of “associate” shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and
(4) a stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the stockholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder’s or Constituent Holder’s (or any of either’s affiliates) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder’s (including any Constituent Holder’s) ownership of
15


shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that in all such cases is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings.
(b) For purposes of this section 12, the “Required Information” that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the corporation’s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these by-laws notwithstanding, the corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or the Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(c) To be timely, a stockholder’s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the corporation within the time periods applicable to stockholder notices of nominations pursuant to article II, section 10(a)(2) of these by-laws. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.
(d) The number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the board of directors decides to nominate as board of directors’ nominees) appearing in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 25% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 12 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”);
provided
,
however
, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
(1)
the number of such director candidates for which the corporation shall have received one or more valid stockholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to article II, section 10 of these by-laws;
16


(2)
the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (2) equals or exceeds one (1); and
(3)
the number of directors in office that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the corporation’s proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this section 12, other than any such director referred to in this clause (3) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;
provided, further, in the event that, as a result of one or more vacancies, the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(e) An “Eligible Stockholder” is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this section 12, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and,
17


if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer (a “Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (e);
provided
, that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this section 12. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this section 12 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder’s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on the dates referred to above and through the date of the applicable annual meeting (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).
(f) No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, an Eligible Stockholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide the following information in writing to the secretary of the corporation:
(1) with respect to each Constituent Holder, the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(i) of these by-laws;
(2) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three (3)-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3) years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person’s agreement to provide:
(A)
within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person’s continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares
18


through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person’s ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and
(B)
immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of stockholders;
(3) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the preceding three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) and its or their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee(s), and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including but not limited to all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder), or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the Stockholder Nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(4)
a representation that such person:
(A)
acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the corporation, and does not presently have such intent;
has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the board of directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Stockholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this section 12;
(C)
has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Stockholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the board of directors;
(D)
will not distribute to any stockholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the corporation; and
19


(E)
will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the corporation and its stockholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this section 12;
(5)
in the case of a nomination by a group of stockholders that together constitutes an Eligible Stockholder, the designation by all group members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating stockholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and
(6)
an undertaking that such person agrees to:
assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the corporation and each of its directors, officers and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation of the Eligible Stockholder’s communications with the stockholders of the corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Stockholder provided to the corporation; and
(A)
file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation by the Eligible Stockholder of stockholders of the corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Stockholder Nominee will be nominated.
In addition, no later than the final date on which a Proxy Access Notice may be submitted under this section 12, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder must provide to the secretary of the corporation documentation reasonably satisfactory to the board of directors that demonstrates that the funds included within the Qualifying Fund are either part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer.
20


In order to be considered timely, any information required by this section 12 to be provided to the corporation must be updated and supplemented (by delivery to the secretary of the corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth (5th) day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Stockholder or other person to change or add any proposed Stockholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including, without limitation, under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any defect.
(g) The Eligible Stockholder may provide to the secretary of the corporation, at the time the information required by this section 12 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee (the “Statement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 12, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes: (i) is materially false or misleading or omits to state any material fact, (ii) would violate any applicable law, regulation or listing standard, or (iii) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person.
(h) No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must:
(1) complete, sign and submit all questionnaires, representations and agreements and provide all information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(iii) of these by-laws and of the corporation’s directors generally; and
(2) provide such additional information as necessary to permit the board of directors to determine if such Stockholder Nominee:
(A) is independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the corporation’s directors;
21


(B) has any direct or indirect relationship with the corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines;
(C) would, by serving on the board of directors, violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is then listed or any applicable law, rule or regulation; and
(D) has been, is or would be subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Stockholder Nominee to the corporation or its stockholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the secretary of the corporation of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including, without limitation, under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any such defect.
(i) Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the corporation’s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of stockholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this section 12 or any other provision of the corporation’s by-laws, Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of stockholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of stockholders.
(j) The corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation):
22


(1) who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing independence of the corporation’s directors, in each case as determined by the board of directors;
(2) whose service as a member of the board of directors would violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation;
(3)
who is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914;
(4)
if the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable Stockholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations pursuant to this section 12 or any agreement, representation or undertaking required by this section 12; or
(5)
if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to be an Eligible Stockholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.
(k) For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph (j), clauses (1), (2) and (3) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Stockholder Nominee, clause (4), will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to be nominated;
provided
,
however
, that clause (5) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (4), will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Stockholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Stockholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of all of the applicable stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of stockholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees to be nominated). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the corporation shall not be required to include,
23


pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any special meeting of stockholders.

stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting regular, periodic cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, the Award limits set forth in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, and in the exercise or purchase price per share under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants’ rights under the Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as “effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.” If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Awards are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become shares of another corporation (the
“
New Shares

), the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Awards to provide that such Awards are for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise or purchase price per share of, the outstanding Awards shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Committee, in its discretion. Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the exercise or purchase price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In no event may the exercise or purchase price, if any, under any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to such Award. The Committee in its discretion, may also make such adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate, including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods. The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section shall be final, binding and conclusive.
4.5

Maximum Number of Shares Issuable Pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed 7,800,000 shares. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to all Awards other than Incentive Stock Options shall be the number of shares determined in accordance with Section 4.1, subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.
(b)
Persons Eligible.
An Incentive Stock Option may be granted only to a person who, on the effective date of grant, is an Employee of the Company, a Parent Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation (each being an

”
). Any person who is not an Employee of an ISO-Qualifying Corporation on the effective date of the grant of an Option to such person may be granted only a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
(c)
Fair Market Value Limitation.
To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code. If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising. In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first. Upon exercise of the Option, shares issued pursuant to each such portion shall be separately identified.

14


vest earlier than one year following the date of grant of such Award and no Award which vests on the basis of attainment of performance goals shall provide for a performance period of less than one year; provided, however, that such limitations shall not preclude the acceleration of vesting of such Award upon the death or Disability of the Participant, or in connection with a Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its discretion and subject to the terms of the Plan or limit the vesting of awards assumed or substituted by the Company in the manner provided by Section 4.5.

A Stock Tender Exercise shall not be permitted if it would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company’s stock. If required by the Company, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for a period of time required by the Company (and not used for another option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.

16


(2) the Participant shall pay to the Company in cash the remaining balance of such aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued.
6.4
Effect of Termination of Employment or Service.

(i)
Disability.
If the Participant’s employment or service terminates because of the Disability of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for vested shares on the date on which the Participant’s employment or service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the date of expiration of the Option’s term as set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option (the

The Participant’s employment or service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Participant dies within three (3) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the Participant’s termination of employment or service.

(iv)
Other Termination of Employment or Service.
If the Participant’s employment or service terminates for any reason, except Disability, death or Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for vested shares on the date on which the Participant’s employment or service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the date on which the Participant’s employment or service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
17


(b)
Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than termination of employment or service for Cause, if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.4(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section 12 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provisions or (ii) the end of the applicable time period under Section 6.4(a), but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
6.5

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option, an Option shall be assignable or transferable subject to the applicable limitations, if any, described in the General Instructions to Form S-8 under the Securities Act or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, only as permitted by applicable regulations under Section 421 of the Code in a manner that does not disqualify such Option as an Incentive Stock Option.

7.1
Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 8.4.

7.2
Purchase Price.
No monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) shall be required as a condition of receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the consideration for which shall be services actually rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit.

Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, shall be paid by crediting the Participant with a cash amount or with additional whole Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock, as determined by the Committee. Such cash amount or additional Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions and shall be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Restricted Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as are applicable to the Award.
7.5
Effect of Termination of Employment or Service.
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Unit Award, if a Participant’s employment or service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant’s death or Disability), then the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Award which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant’s termination of employment or service.
7.6

The Company shall issue to a Participant on the date on which Restricted Stock Units subject to the Participant’s Restricted Stock Unit Award vest or on such other date determined by the Committee in compliance with Section 409A, if applicable, and set forth in the Award Agreement one (1) share of Stock (and/or any other new, substituted or additional securities or other property pursuant to an adjustment
19


described in Section 7.4) for each Restricted Stock Unit then becoming vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes, if any. If permitted by the Committee, the Participant may elect, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, to defer receipt of all or any portion of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred issuance date(s) and amount(s) elected by the Participant shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide for settlement of any Restricted Stock Unit Award by payment to the Participant in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the payment date of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section.
7.7
Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.
The right to receive shares pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in granting a Performance Award, each Performance Share shall have an initial monetary value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.4, on the effective date of grant of the Performance Share, and each Performance Unit shall have an initial monetary value established by the Committee at the time of grant. The final value payable to the Participant in settlement of a Performance Award determined on the basis of the applicable Performance Award Formula will depend on the extent to which Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained within the applicable Performance Period established by the Committee.
20


8.3
Establishment of Performance Period, Performance Goals and Performance Award Formula.
In granting each Performance Award, the Committee shall establish in writing the applicable Performance Period (subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.5), Performance Award Formula and one or more Performance Goals which, when measured at the end of the Performance Period, shall determine on the basis of the Performance Award Formula the final value of the Performance Award to be paid to the Participant. The Company shall notify each Participant granted a Performance Award of the terms of such Award, including the Performance Period, Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula.
8.4
Measurement of Performance Goals.
Performance Goals shall be established by the Committee on the basis of targets to be attained (
“
Performance Targets
”
) with respect to one or more measures of business or financial performance or other criteria established by the Committee (each, a
Performance Measure
), subject to the following:
(a)
Performance Measures.
Performance Measures based on objective criteria shall be calculated in accordance with the Company’s financial statements, or, if such measures are not reported in the Company’s financial statements, they shall be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a method used generally in the Company’s industry, or in accordance with a methodology established by the Committee prior to the grant of the Performance Award. Performance Measures based on subjective criteria shall be determined on the basis established by the Committee in granting the Award. As specified by the Committee, Performance Measures may be calculated with respect to the Company and each Subsidiary Corporation consolidated therewith for financial reporting purposes, one or more Subsidiary Corporations or such division or other business unit of any of them selected by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee prior to the grant of the Performance Award, the Performance Measures applicable to the Performance Award shall be calculated prior to the accrual of expense for any Performance Award for the same Performance Period and excluding the effect (whether positive or negative) on the Performance Measures of any change in accounting standards or any unusual or infrequently occurring event or transaction, as determined by the Committee, occurring after the establishment of the Performance Goals applicable to the Performance Award. Each such adjustment, if any, shall be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of Performance Measures in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant’s rights with respect to a Performance Award. Performance Measures may be based upon a number of different metrics, as determined by the Committee in its discretion (e.g., revenue, operating income, operating margin, and/or total shareholder return).
(b)
Performance Targets.
Performance Targets may include a minimum, maximum, target level and intermediate levels of performance, with the final value of a Performance Award determined under the applicable Performance Award Formula by the Performance Target level attained during the applicable Performance Period. A Performance
21


Target may be stated as an absolute value, an increase or decrease in a value, or as a value determined relative to an index, budget or other standard selected by the Committee.
8.5

(b)
Discretionary Adjustment of Award Formula.
In its discretion, the Committee may, either at the time it grants a Performance Award or at any time thereafter, provide for the positive or negative adjustment of the Performance Award Formula applicable to a Performance Award to reflect such Participant’s individual performance in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine.
(c)
Notice to Participants.
As soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination in accordance with Sections 8.5(a) and (b), the Company shall notify each Participant of the determination of the Committee.
(d)
Payment in Settlement of Performance Awards.
As soon as practicable following the Committee’s determination in accordance with Sections 8.5(a) and (b), but in any event within the short-term deferral period within the meaning of Section 409A, payment shall be made to each eligible Participant (or such Participant’s legal representative or other person who acquired the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant’s death) of the final value of the Participant’s Performance Award. Payment of such amount shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award, payment shall be made in a lump sum. If permitted by the Committee, the Participant may elect, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, to defer receipt of all or any portion of the payment to be made to the Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred payment date(s) elected by the Participant shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. If any payment is to be made on a deferred basis, the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, provide for the payment during the deferral period of Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest.
(e)
Provisions Applicable to Payment in Shares.
If payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of such shares shall be determined by dividing the final value of the Performance Award by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock determined by the method specified in the Award Agreement. Shares of Stock issued in payment of any Performance Award may be fully vested and freely transferable shares or may be shares of Stock subject to Vesting Conditions. Any shares subject to Vesting Conditions shall be evidenced by an appropriate Award Agreement and subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee.

8.6
Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.
Participants shall have no voting or dividend rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Performance Share Award that the Participant shall be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date the Award is granted and ending, with respect to each share subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date on which the Performance Shares are settled or the date on which they are forfeited. Such Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, shall be credited to the Participant either in cash or in the form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock, as determined by the Committee. The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number), if any, to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on the dividend payment date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date. Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, shall be accumulated and paid to the extent that the related Performance Shares become nonforfeitable. Settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights may be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance Share as provided in Section 8.5. Dividend Equivalent Rights shall not be paid with respect to Performance Units. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Performance Share Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Performance Share Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.
8.7
Effect of Termination of Employment or Service.

(a)
Death or Disability.
If the Participant’s employment or service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant’s Performance Award shall be determined by the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and shall be prorated based on the number of months of the Participant’s employment or service during the Performance Period. Payment shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 8.5.
23


(b)
Other Termination of Employment or Service.
If the Participant’s employment or service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award shall be forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant’s employment or service, the Committee, in its discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such Award and determine the final value of the Performance Award in the manner provided by Section 8.7(a). Payment of any amount pursuant to this Section shall be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 8.5.
8.8
Nontransferability of Performance Awards.

Other Stock-Based Awards may be made available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards or as payment in lieu of compensation to which a Participant is otherwise entitled.

However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Other Stock-Based Award that the Participant shall be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date such Award is granted and ending, with respect to each share subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date the Award is settled or the date on which it is terminated. Such Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 7.4. Dividend Equivalent Rights shall not be granted with respect to Cash-Based Awards. In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.4, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant’s Other Stock-Based Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of such Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions and performance criteria, if any, as are applicable to the Award.
9.6
Effect of Termination of Employment or Service

Change in Control
11.1
Effect of Change in Control on Nonemployee Director Awards.
Subject to the requirements and limitations of Section 409A, if applicable, including as provided by Section 13.4, in the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Nonemployee Director Award shall become immediately exercisable and vested in full and, except to the extent assumed, continued or substituted for pursuant to Section 11.2(a), shall be settled effective immediately prior to the time of consummation of the Change in Control.
11.2
Effect of Change in Control on Awards.
In the event of a Change in Control, outstanding Awards shall be subject to the definitive agreement entered into by the Company in connection with the Change in Control. Subject to the requirements and limitations
26


of Section 409A, if applicable, the Committee may provide pursuant to such agreement for any one or more of the following:
(a)
Assumption, Continuation or Substitution.
In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the
“
Acquiror
”
), may, without the consent of any Participant, assume or continue the Company’s rights and obligations under each or any Award or portion thereof outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control or substitute for each or any such outstanding Award or portion thereof a substantially equivalent award with respect to the Acquiror’s stock, as applicable. For purposes of this Section, if so determined by the Committee in its discretion, an Award denominated in shares of Stock shall be deemed assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, for each share of Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, other securities or property or a combination thereof) to which a holder of a share of Stock on the effective date of the Change in Control was entitled (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiror, the Committee may, with the consent of the Acquiror, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise or settlement of the Award, for each share of Stock subject to the Award, to consist solely of common stock of the Acquiror equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control. Any Award or portion thereof which is neither assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised or settled as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control.
(b)
Cash-Out of Outstanding Stock-Based Awards.
The Committee may, in its discretion and without the consent of any Participant, determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each or any Award denominated in shares of Stock or portion thereof outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control and not previously exercised or settled shall be canceled in exchange for a payment with respect to each vested share of Stock subject to such canceled Award in (i) cash, (ii) stock of the Company or of a corporation or other business entity a party to the Change in Control, or (iii) other property which, in any such case, shall be in an amount having a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control, reduced (but not below zero) by the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, under such Award. In the event such determination is made by the Committee, an Award having an exercise or purchase price per share equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control may be canceled without payment of consideration to the holder thereof. Payment pursuant to this Section (reduced by applicable withholding taxes, if any) shall be made to Participants as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, if applicable.
27


(c)
Accelerated Vesting of Time-Vesting Awards.
The Committee may, in its discretion, provide that if either:
(i) the Acquiror will not assume or continue the Time-Vesting Award or substitute a substantially equivalent award pursuant to Section 11.2(a), in each case for equity securities of the Acquiror which are or promptly will be registered under the Securities Act and tradable on an established United States securities exchange, or
(ii) the Acquiror has so assumed, continued or substituted for the Time-Vesting Award, but the Participant’s employment or service terminates as a result of Involuntary Termination,
then the exercisability, vesting and/or settlement of the Time-Vesting Award and shares acquired pursuant thereto will accelerate in full or in part to such extent as the Committee determines.
(d)
Accelerated or Pro Rata Settlement of Performance-Vesting Awards.
(i) the Acquiror will not assume or continue the Performance-Vesting Award or substitute a substantially equivalent award pursuant to Section 11.2(a), in each case for equity securities of the Acquiror which are or promptly will be registered under the Securities Act and tradable on an established United States securities exchange, or
(ii) the Acquiror has so assumed, continued or substituted for the Performance-Vesting Award, but the Participant’s employment or service terminates as a result of Involuntary Termination,
then the exercisability, vesting and/or settlement of the Performance-Vesting Award and shares acquired pursuant thereto will be determined, as specified by the Committee, either (A) based upon the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals(s) under the terms of the Performance-Vesting Award through the date of the Change in Control or the Involuntary Termination, as applicable or (B) to such extent as would occur under the terms of the Performance-Vesting Award had 100% of the target level of the applicable performance goals(s) been achieved but with the result prorated based on the period of the Participant’s actual employment or service during the applicable full performance period.
11.3
Federal Excise Tax Under Section 4999 of the Code.
(a)
Excess Parachute Payment.
If any acceleration of vesting pursuant to an Award and any other payment or benefit received or to be received by a Participant would subject the Participant to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code due to the characterization of such acceleration of vesting, payment or benefit as an “excess parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code, then, provided such election would not subject the
28


Participant to taxation under Section 409A, the Participant may elect to reduce the amount of any acceleration of vesting called for under the Award in order to avoid such characterization.
(b)
Determination by Tax Firm.
To aid the Participant in making any election called for under Section 11.3(a), no later than the date of the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in an “excess parachute payment” to the Participant as described in Section 11.3(a), the Company shall request a determination in writing by the professional firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes, or, if the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the Acquiror, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section (the “
Tax Firm
”). As soon as practicable thereafter, the Tax Firm shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant. For the purposes of such determination, the Tax Firm may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Tax Firm such information and documents as the Tax Firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination. The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Tax Firm charges in connection with its services contemplated by this Section.
12.
Compliance with Securities Law
.
The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to any Award shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of such exercise or issuance be in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award, or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company’s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under the Plan shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.
13.
Compliance with Section 409A
13.1
In General.
The Plan is intended to be administered in a manner consistent with the requirements, where applicable, of Section 409A. Where reasonably possible and practicable, the Plan shall be administered in a manner to avoid the imposition on Participants of immediate tax recognition and additional taxes pursuant to such Section 409A.
29


Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither any Participating Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to any person for any tax, penalty or interest in the event such Section 409A applies to any such Award in a manner that results in adverse tax consequences for the Participant or any of the Participant’s beneficiaries or transferees.
13.2
Applicable Requirements.
To the extent any of the Awards granted under this Plan are deemed Section 409A Deferred Compensation, the following rules shall apply to such Awards:
(a)
Timing of Payments.
Payment(s) of compensation that is subject to Section 409A shall only be made upon an event or at a time set forth in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3, i.e., the Participant’s separation from service, the Participant’s becoming disabled, the Participant’s death, at a time or a fixed schedule specified in the Plan or an Award Agreement, a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, or the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency.
(b)
Certain Delayed Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an amount was intended to be paid such that it would have qualified as a short-term deferral under Section 409A and the applicable regulations, then such payment is or could be delayed if the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) are met.
(c)
Acceleration of Payment.
Any payment made under this Plan to which Section 409A applies may not be accelerated, except in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4), i.e., upon a Participant’s separation from service, the Participant becomes disabled, the Participant’s death, a change of ownership or effective control, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets, or upon an unforeseeable emergency (all as detailed in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(a)).
13.3
Series of Payments.
Any payment made pursuant to any Award shall be considered a separate payment and not one of a series of payments for purposes of Section 409A.
13.4
Required Delay in Payment to Specified Employee Pursuant to Separation from Service.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A, no payment in settlement of an Award providing for Section 409A Deferred Compensation may be made to a Participant who is a “specified employee” (as defined by Section 409A) as of the date of the Participant’s separation from service before the date (the
“
Delayed Payment Date
”
) that is six (6) months after the date of such Participant’s separation from service, or, if earlier, the date of the Participant’s death. All such amounts that would, but for this paragraph, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date shall be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date.

The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Award Agreement, or to make any payment in cash under the Plan until the Participating Company Group’s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant.
14.2
Withholding in or Directed Sale of Shares.
The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of any Participating Company. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates (or the maximum individual statutory withholding rates for the applicable jurisdiction if use of such rates would not result in adverse accounting consequences or cost). The Company may require a Participant to direct a broker, upon the vesting, exercise or settlement of an Award, to sell a portion of the shares subject to the Award determined by the Company in its discretion to be sufficient to cover the tax withholding obligations of any Participating Company and to remit an amount equal to such tax withholding obligations to such Participating Company in cash.
15.
Amendment, Suspension or Termination of Plan
The Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, and (c) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company’s stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule, including the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Stock may then be listed or quoted. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Committee. Except as provided by the next sentence, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan may have a materially adverse effect on any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may, in
31


its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any Participant, amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as it deems necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or such Award Agreement to any present or future law, regulation or rule applicable to the Plan, including, but not limited to, Section 409A.

Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of employment or service for Cause or any act by a Participant, whether before or after termination of employment or service, that would constitute Cause for termination of employment or service, or any accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirements of securities laws as a result of which, and to the extent that, such reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment is required by applicable securities laws. In addition, to the extent that claw-back or similar provisions applicable to Awards are required by applicable law, listing standards and/or policies adopted by the Company, Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to such provisions.

16.5
Rights as a Stockholder.

16.9
Beneficiary Designation.
Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant’s death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant’s lifetime. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant’s spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant’s spouse. If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant’s death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant’s legal representative.
16.10
Severability

No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations. The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder. Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant’s creditors in any assets of any Participating Company. The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.
34
