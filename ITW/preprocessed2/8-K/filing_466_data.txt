Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
April 25, 2019
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2019
first
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the first quarter discrete tax benefit of $14 million related to foreign tax credits from the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company also excluded the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit
Exhibit 99.1
ITW Delivers $1.81 Earnings per Share
Reaffirms FY 2019 EPS Guidance of $7.90 to $8.20
GLENVIEW, IL., April 25, 2019
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first-quarter 2019 results including earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81 compared to $1.90 in the first quarter of 2018. As expected, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, higher restructuring costs and a higher effective tax rate reduced EPS by a combined $0.16 year-over-year.
“ITW had a solid start to 2019. We expanded operating margin to 24.3 percent, excluding the impact from accelerated restructuring, as enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points and price/cost was more favorable than expected. We grew Free Cash Flow 21 percent, with conversion of 90 percent, well above our seasonal average. After a slow start in January, sales trends improved across the board as the quarter progressed,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead, our view that continued contributions from enterprise initiatives, improving price/cost dynamics, restructuring benefits, more favorable sales and foreign currency comparisons, and stabilizing auto production in Europe and China will all contribute to a stronger operating environment in the back half of the year is unchanged. As a result, we remain firmly on track to deliver on our full year EPS guidance. As the ITW team continues to execute on our ‘Finish the Job’ agenda, I am confident that we will continue to deliver differentiated financial performance in 2019 and beyond.”
Revenue of $3.6 billion was down five percent, with an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 3.4 percent and organic revenue down 1.5 percent. Excluding the impact of one less shipping day in the quarter, organic revenue was flat. Organic revenue growth by segment was as follows: Welding grew three percent, Food Equipment grew two percent; Test & Measurement/Electronics, Polymers & Fluids and Construction Products were down one percent, Specialty Products down two percent, and Automotive OEM down six percent. As expected, the company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by 70 basis points.
Operating margin was 23.6 percent, as compared to 24.1 percent in the prior year. Excluding 70 basis points of unfavorable margin impact due to higher restructuring expenses, operating margin improved 20 basis points to 24.3 percent. Strong execution on enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin improvement and price/cost diluted margin by 10 basis points. Free Cash Flow increased 21 percent to $539 million, with 90 percent conversion, and the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares. After-tax return on invested capital was 27.7 percent.
2019 Guidance
The company is reaffirming its full-year EPS guidance of $7.90 to $8.20 per share, which represents four to eight percent growth year over year. Factoring in the slower start to the year, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 percent. The company expects full-year operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be above 100 percent of net income, and the company is on pace to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its shares in 2019. The effective tax rate is expected to be 24.5 to 25.5 percent.
