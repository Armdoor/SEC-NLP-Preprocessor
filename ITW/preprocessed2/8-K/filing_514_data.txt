Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 24, 2018
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2018
third
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents certain financial measures for 2017 excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the confidential legal settlement from the calculation of ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., October 24, 2018
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.90 per share. As previously disclosed, the company recorded an EPS benefit of $0.14 per share related to a legal settlement in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding this item, EPS increased 11 percent. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $(0.03), EPS grew 13 percent.
“Despite some near-term market challenges in the third quarter, the ITW team delivered 11 percent earnings growth and EPS at the high end of our guidance range. We improved operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.6 percent, with continued strong execution of Enterprise Initiatives contributing 100 basis points of margin expansion. Pricing actions more than offset material cost inflation on a dollar for dollar basis, and price/cost margin percentage dilution showed sequential improvement versus the second quarter,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Overall market conditions in North America remained solid this quarter, while auto production in Europe and China and demand levels in several international end markets served by our Specialty and Polymers & Fluids segments softened versus the first half of the year and were below our expectations heading into the quarter. Our business model continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by 17 percent free cash flow growth in the quarter, supporting our ability to raise our dividend 28 percent and repurchase $500 million of our shares in the quarter.”
“While we expect that these near-term market challenges will continue in the fourth quarter, we remain firmly on track to deliver our full-year EPS guidance with 15 percent earnings growth at the mid-point,” added Santi. “Our ability to deliver consistent, strong results across a wide range of economic scenarios is a direct reflection of the resilience of our high-quality diversified business portfolio, the strength of ITW’s proprietary Business Model and our team’s focused execution of ITW’s long-term strategy.”
Total revenue was flat as two percent organic growth was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth increased four percent in North America, offset by a one percent decline in
Europe and a two percent decline in Asia Pacific. As expected, ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by 70 basis points.
According to IHS, automotive production in Europe declined five percent in the third quarter following four percent growth in the second quarter, while China automotive production declined four percent following 11 percent growth in the second quarter. As a result, in the third quarter, our European Automotive OEM business declined six percent, following three percent growth in the second quarter, while our China Auto OEM business was flat, following 17 percent growth in the second quarter.
In North America, organic growth remained solid as Welding grew 10 percent, Automotive OEM seven percent, Food Equipment four percent and Polymers & Fluids three percent.
Operating margin was 24.6 percent, an improvement of 30 basis points excluding the 2017 legal settlement, as Enterprise Initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin improvement. Price/cost margin dilution impact in the third quarter improved to (60) basis points from (70) basis points in the second quarter of 2018.
After-tax return on invested capital was 28.0 percent, an improvement of 400 basis points resulting primarily from new U.S. tax rules and regulations. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 23.7 percent.
Free Cash Flow was $743 million, an increase of 17 percent, and 116 percent of net income. In the quarter, the company repurchased $500 million of its own shares and raised its dividend 28 percent to an annualized $4.00 per share. Year-to-date, the company has repurchased $1.5 billion of its own shares.


2018 Guidance
Full-year EPS guidance was narrowed to a range of $7.55 to $7.65 per share, or 15 percent growth at the mid-point, with revenue up three to four percent, and organic growth of two to three percent. Prior year GAAP EPS of $4.86 included a ($1.90) per share impact from tax reform and a $0.17 per share impact from the legal settlement. Excluding these two items, 2017 adjusted EPS was $6.59 per share. The company expects to repurchase approximately $2.0 billion of its own shares in 2018.
For the fourth quarter 2018, the company expects GAAP EPS of $1.78 to $1.88, with revenue essentially flat as the impact of foreign currency translation, at current exchange rates, is expected to offset organic growth of one to two percent based on current levels of demand. Prior year GAAP EPS of ($0.22) included a $1.92 per share impact from tax reform. Excluding this item, adjusted EPS was $1.70 per share.
