Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 24, 2017
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2017
second
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., July 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its second-quarter 2017 results.
Second-quarter GAAP earnings were $1.69 per share, an increase of 16% versus the second quarter of 2016. Revenue grew 4.9% to $3.6 billion. Organic revenue increased 2.6% while the 2016 acquisition of Engineered Fasteners & Components (EF&C) added 3.5% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 1.2%.
Operating income of $874 million for the second quarter was up 10% and was the highest quarterly income total in the company’s history. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.3%, an increase of 120 basis points. Excluding the margin impact from EF&C, operating margin was 24.9%, an increase of 180 basis points year-on-year with 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital was 24.8%, an improvement of 190 basis points. Second-quarter net income was $587 million.
“Our second quarter performance reflects continued progress in our focus on leveraging ITW’s differentiated business model and diversified high-quality business portfolio to full potential,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “I once again thank the entire ITW team for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. Due to their efforts, ITW is well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance through the balance of 2017 and beyond.”
Organic revenue growth was positive in six of seven segments: 4% in Automotive OEM, 4% in Test & Measurement/Electronics, 4% in Specialty Products, 3% in Welding, 2% in Construction Products, and 1% in Food Equipment. Polymers & Fluids was down 1%.
During the second quarter, the company recorded an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share related to a legal settlement. Excluding this item, second quarter earnings were $1.66 per share, an increase of 14% versus the prior year.
Full-Year and Third Quarter 2017 Guidance
As a result of the company’s strong second quarter results, ITW is raising its 2017 full-year EPS guidance by $0.12 at the mid-point. The company now expects earnings to be in the range of $6.32 to $6.52 per share, up from prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40 per share, with organic revenue growth of 2 to 4%. ITW expects operating margin of approximately 24% and free cash flow to exceed 100% of net income. The company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 29%.
For the third quarter 2017, the company expects earnings to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.67 per share with organic growth of 1 to 3%.
The company’s third quarter and revised full-year EPS guidance does not include any EPS benefit from the previously disclosed legal settlement beyond the $0.03 per share recorded in the second quarter.
