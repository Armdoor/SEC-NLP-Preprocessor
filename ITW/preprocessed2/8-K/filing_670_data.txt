Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
January 25, 2017
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2016
fourth
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., January, 25 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results.
“The fourth quarter closed out a year of record financial performance and strong execution by the ITW team. In 2016, we grew EPS 11%, improved operating margin by 110 basis points to an all-time high of 22.5% and increased after tax return on invested capital 170 basis points to a record 22.1%,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout 2016, we continued to invest in our businesses to sustain above-market organic growth, strengthened our highly differentiated business portfolio and returned more than $2.8 billion of surplus capital to shareholders. We continue to work hard to push our performance to
best-in-class levels, and we are well-positioned to deliver continued progress and strong results in 2017.
Fourth-quarter GAAP earnings were $1.45 per share, an increase of 18% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Foreign currency translation reduced EPS by 2% year-on-year. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $3.4 billion. Organic revenue increased 2% while the 2016 acquisition of Engineered Fasteners & Components (EF&C) added 4% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 2% year-on-year and Product Line Simplification (PLS) reduced revenue by approximately 1%.
During the fourth quarter the company recorded a net EPS benefit of $0.06 per share, related to a dividend distribution from its investment in Wilsonart, which was partially offset by one-time charges related to two small divestitures. Excluding these non-recurring items, fourth quarter earnings were $1.39 per share, an increase of 13% versus the prior year.
Operating income was $742 million and operating margin for the quarter was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points year-on-year. Excluding the margin dilution from the 2016 acquisition of EF&C, operating margin was 22.2%, an increase of 150 basis points year-on-year with 130 basis points of margin expansion coming from Enterprise Initiatives. Fourth-quarter net income was $507 million and the company converted 117 percent of net income to free cash flow.
Organic revenue growth was positive in five of seven segments; 7% in Automotive OEM, 3% in Food Equipment and Construction Products, 2% in Polymers & Fluids, 1% in Specialty Products with Test & Measurement/Electronics flat and a decline of 8% in Welding.
Operating margin improved in all seven segments to 24.7% in Food Equipment, 24.4% in Welding, 24% in Specialty Products, 23% in Automotive OEM (25.2% excluding the margin dilution from EF&C), 21.4% in Construction Products, 20.1% in Test & Measurement/Electronics and 19% in Polymers & Fluids.
Full-year 2016 GAAP earnings were $5.70 per share, an increase of 11%. Total revenue increased 1% to $13.6 billion with organic growth of 1%. The acquisition of EF&C increased revenue 2%. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 2%.
Full-year operating margin was 22.5%, up 110 basis points versus 2015, or up 140 basis points to 22.8% excluding the margin dilution impact from EF&C. ITW converted 100% of net income to free cash flow for the year and generated 22.1% after-tax return on invested capital. For the full year, ITW paid $821 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased $2 billion of its own shares.


Full-Year and First Quarter 2017 Guidance
ITW is reaffirming its 2017 full-year performance expectations. The company expects 2017 earnings to be in the range of $6.00 to $6.20 per share with organic growth of 1.5 to 3.5%. ITW also expects operating margin to exceed 23.5% and free cash flow conversion to exceed 100% for the full-year.
The company expects first quarter 2017 earnings to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.49 per share with organic growth of 1 to 2%. The company expects operating margin to exceed 22.5%.
