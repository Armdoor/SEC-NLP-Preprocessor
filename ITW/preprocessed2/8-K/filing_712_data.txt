Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 20, 2016
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2016
second
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies
. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., July 20, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported second quarter 2016 diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, a 12% increase compared to the year-ago period. Operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.1%, operating income of $792 million was up 8%, and after-tax return on invested capital increased by 260 basis points to 22.9%. Second quarter results for all three of these key metrics were all-time highs for the company. Organic revenue increased 2% excluding Product Line Simplification (PLS) as six of the company’s seven segments delivered positive year on year growth, while the overall demand environment in the Welding segment remained challenging with revenue down 11% in the quarter. The company’s ongoing PLS activities reduced overall organic revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage-point resulting in net organic growth for the company of 1% in the quarter.
"I am very pleased with ITW’s performance in the quarter. The fact that we achieved best ever operating income, operating margin, and return on invested capital performance reinforces both our conviction in the strength of the differentiated performance potential that resides within the ITW Business Model and the excellent progress that our ITW colleagues around the world continue to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential.” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "I am also pleased with the progress that our segments are making in executing our framework for accelerated organic revenue growth, as evidenced by the fact that six of our seven segments delivered positive year on year organic growth in the quarter. As a result, we were able to overcome the continued challenging demand environment in our Welding segment and deliver 12% earnings per share growth.”

2016 Guidance
ITW is raising its 2016 full-year GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $5.50 to $5.70, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the mid-point. The company is also narrowing its full-year organic growth forecast to 1 to 2% (prior forecast of 1 to 3%) as a result of the lingering difficult market conditions being experienced by the Welding segment. Consistent with prior guidance, the forecast includes approximately 1%-point of PLS impact. Operating margin is expected to exceed 22.5% for the full year. Guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates and includes the expected impact of the Engineered Fasteners & Components (EF&C) acquisition.
On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of EF&C for approximately $450 million. In the second half of 2016, EF&C is expected to add revenues of approximately $220 to $240 million. After acquisition accounting, EF&C is expected to have no EPS impact in the second half of 2016.


For the third quarter 2016, the company expects GAAP EPS to be in a range of $1.42 to $1.52, and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Organic revenue is forecast to be up 1 to 3%.
