Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 9, 2016, Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a $2.5 billion, five year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPM”), as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and a syndicate of Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company pays a facility fee that varies between 0.045% and 0.125%, depending on its credit rating. Advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry, at the Company’s option, either the “base rate” of interest in effect, the “eurocurrency rate,” which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin or a competitive bid rate of interest. Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the “eurocurrency rate” or a competitive bid rate of interest. The “base rate” of interest is the highest of (i) JPM’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% (if one-month LIBOR is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero). The applicable margin includes a market rate spread, which is a rate per annum equal to the five-year credit default swap mid-rate spread. This spread varies between 0.25% and 1.25% depending on the Company’s credit rating.
The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which the Company may request an increase of the total facility up to $4.5 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders’ discretion. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four-quarter period then ended to Total Interest Expense for the same period.
Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, foreign exchange and trust services.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(a) and is incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 5.

. Shares of stock standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the by-laws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.
Shares of stock standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by his administrator or executor, either in person or by proxy.

Shares of stock standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares of stock held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority so to do be contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.
SECTION 6.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided
,
however
, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
5


SECTION 7.

. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these by-laws. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present or represented. No notice other than an announcement at the meeting need be given unless the adjournment is for more than thirty days or a new record date is to be fixed for the adjourned meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these by-laws, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
SECTION 8.
Proxies
. At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by proxy executed in writing or via electronic transmission by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. Proxies shall be valid only with respect to the meeting or meetings, and any adjournment thereof, for which they are given.
SECTION 9.
Voting

(G) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the preceding three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and its or their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, but not limited to, all
9


information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the stockholder making the nomination and any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(H) completed, signed and submitted copies of all questionnaires, representations and agreements required by these by-laws and of the corporation’s directors generally; and
(I) an undertaking to provide such other information as the corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person.
(b)
Special Meetings of Stockholders
. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting of stockholders pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made (i) by the board of directors at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether such special meeting was called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II or section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws), (ii) by stockholders in accordance with the notice and other requirements set forth in section 2(b) of article II of these by-laws at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that was called pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws or (iii) by stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that was called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II of these by-laws,
provided
, that any such stockholder (A) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section 10 and at the time of the special meeting, (B) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section 10. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations for director before a special meeting of stockholders.
For nominations or proposals to be properly brought by a stockholder at a special meeting called pursuant to section 2(a)(i) of article II of these by-laws, the stockholder must have given timely notice of the nomination or proposal to the secretary of the corporation, and timely updates and supplements thereof, in each case in the form required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section 10. To be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred
10


twentieth (120th) day before the date of such special meeting and not later than the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the special meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board of directors, in its discretion, may determine that a stockholder nomination or proposal, even if complying with the notice requirements in this section 10(b), shall not be brought before a special meeting if:
(A) the proposal relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law;
(B) the proposal or nomination was submitted in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law; or
(C) the stockholder making the proposal or nomination violated the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act.
(c)
General
.
(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10, shall be eligible to be elected as directors at a meeting of stockholders, and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these by-laws, including this section 10, and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these by-laws, including this section 10, to declare that such proposed nomination or business shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section 10 shall preclude the board of directors or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee from making nominations for the election of directors or proposing business to be transacted at any special meeting of stockholders that is called pursuant to section 2(a)(ii) of article II of these by-laws.
11


(2) For purposes of this section 10, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the PR Newswire or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Nothing in this section 10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of (i) stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) the holders of any series of preferred stock if and to the extent provided for under law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws.
SECTION 11.
Election of Directors
. Except as provided in article III, section 8 of these by-laws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present;
provided
,
however
, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i)(a) the secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the board of directors in compliance with the requirements set forth in article II, section 10 or article II, section 12, as applicable, of these by-laws or (b) the secretary of the corporation receives a valid Special Meeting Request pursuant to article II, section 2(b) of these by-laws for the election of directors; and (ii) such nomination or Special Meeting Request, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn by such stockholder as of a date that is ten (10) days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented). For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” that director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has established procedures regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting.
SECTION 12.
Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials
.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these by-laws, the corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the “Stockholder Nominee”) to the board of directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders that satisfies the requirements of this section 12, including qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this section 12 (a “Proxy Access Notice”) to have its nominee included in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12. For the purposes of this section 12:
12


(1) “Voting Stock” shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors;
(2) “Constituent Holder” shall mean any stockholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined below) or qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below);
(3) “affiliate” and “associate” shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Securities Act;
provided
,
however
, that the term “partner” as used in the definition of “associate” shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and
(4) a stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the stockholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder’s or Constituent Holder’s (or any of either’s affiliates) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into
13


such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder’s (including any Constituent Holder’s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that in all such cases is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings.
(b) For purposes of this section 12, the “Required Information” that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the corporation’s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these by-laws notwithstanding, the corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or the Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(c) To be timely, a stockholder’s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the corporation within the time periods applicable to stockholder notices of nominations pursuant to article II, section 10(a)(2) of these by-laws. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.
(d) The number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the board of directors decides to nominate as board of directors’ nominees) appearing in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 25% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 12 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”);
provided
,
however
, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
14


(1) the number of such director candidates for which the corporation shall have received one or more valid stockholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to article II, section 10 of these by-laws;
(2) the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (2) equals or exceeds one (1); and
(3) the number of directors in office that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the corporation’s proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this section 12, other than any such director referred to in this clause (3) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;
provided, further, in the event that, as a result of one or more vacancies, the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(e) An “Eligible Stockholder” is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this section 12, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting,
15


at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer (a “Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (e);
provided
, that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this section 12. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this section 12 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder’s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on the dates referred to above and through the date of the applicable annual meeting (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).
(f) No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, an Eligible Stockholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide the following information in writing to the secretary of the corporation:
(1) with respect to each Constituent Holder, the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(i) of these by-laws;
(2) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three (3)-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3) years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person’s agreement to provide:
16


(A) within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person’s continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person’s ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and
(B) immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of stockholders;
(3) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the preceding three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) and its or their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee(s), and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including but not limited to all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder), or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the Stockholder Nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(4) a representation that such person:
(A) acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the corporation, and does not presently have such intent;
(B) has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the board of directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Stockholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this section 12;
(C) has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Stockholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the board of directors;
17


(D) will not distribute to any stockholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the corporation; and
(E) will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the corporation and its stockholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this section 12;
(5) in the case of a nomination by a group of stockholders that together constitutes an Eligible Stockholder, the designation by all group members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating stockholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and
(6) an undertaking that such person agrees to:
assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the corporation and each of its directors, officers and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation of the Eligible Stockholder’s communications with the stockholders of the corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Stockholder provided to the corporation; and
(A) file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation by the Eligible Stockholder of stockholders of the corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Stockholder Nominee will be nominated.
In addition, no later than the final date on which a Proxy Access Notice may be submitted under this section 12, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder must provide to the secretary of the corporation documentation reasonably satisfactory to the board of directors that demonstrates that the funds included within the Qualifying Fund are either part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer.
18


In order to be considered timely, any information required by this section 12 to be provided to the corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Stockholder or other person to change or add any proposed Stockholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including, without limitation, under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any defect.
(g) The Eligible Stockholder may provide to the Secretary of the corporation, at the time the information required by this section 12 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee (the “Statement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 12, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes: (i) is materially false or misleading or omits to state any material fact, (ii) would violate any applicable law, regulation or listing standard, or (iii) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person.
(h) No later than the final date when a Proxy Access Notice pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must:
(1) provide an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the board of directors or its designee (which form shall be provided by the corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a stockholder), that such Stockholder Nominee:
(A) consents to being named in the corporation’s proxy statement and form of proxy card (and will not agree to be named in any other person’s proxy statement or form of proxy card) as a nominee and to serving as a director of the corporation if elected;
19


(B) agrees, if elected, to adhere to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles of Conduct and any other publicly available corporation policies and guidelines applicable to directors; and
(C) is not and will not become a party to any compensatory, payment or other financial agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity in connection with his or her nomination, service or action as a director of the corporation, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity as to how the Stockholder Nominee would vote or act on any issue or question as a director, in each case that has not been disclosed to the corporation;
(2) complete, sign and submit all questionnaires, representations and agreements required by these by-laws and of the corporation’s directors generally, including providing the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(iii) of these by-laws; and
(3) provide such additional information as necessary to permit the board of directors to determine if such Stockholder Nominee:
(A) is independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the corporation’s directors;
(B) has any direct or indirect relationship with the corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines;
(C) would, by serving on the board of directors, violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is then listed or any applicable law, rule or regulation; and
20


(D) has been, is or would be subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Stockholder Nominee to the corporation or its stockholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of the corporation of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including, without limitation, under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any such defect.
(i) Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the corporation’s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of stockholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this section 12 or any other provision of the corporation’s by-laws, Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of stockholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of stockholders.
(j) The corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation):
(1) who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing independence of the corporation’s directors, in each case as determined by the board of directors;
(2) whose service as a member of the board of directors would violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation;
21


(3) who is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914;
(4) if the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable Stockholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations pursuant to this section 12 or any agreement, representation or undertaking required by this section 12; or
(5) if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to be an Eligible Stockholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.
(k) For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph (j), clauses (1), (2) and (3) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Stockholder Nominee, clause (4), will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to be nominated;
provided
,
however
, that clause (5) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (4), will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Stockholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Stockholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of all of the applicable stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of stockholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees to be nominated). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any special meeting of stockholders.

(b) For purposes of this section 12, the “Required Information” that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the corporation
s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these by-laws notwithstanding, the corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or
the
Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(c) To be timely, a stockholder
s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the corporation within the time periods applicable to stockholder notices of nominations pursuant to article II, section 10(a)(2) of these by-laws. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.

nominees) appearing in the corporation
s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 25% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 12 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”);
provided
,
however
, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
14


(1)
the number of such director candidates for which the corporation shall have received one or more valid stockholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to article II, section 10 of these by-laws;
(2)
the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the corporation
’
s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (2) equals or exceeds one (1); and
(3)
the number of directors in office that will be included in the corporation
s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the corporation
s proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this section 12, other than any such director referred to in this clause (3) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;
provided, further, in the event that, as a result of one or more vacancies, the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation
s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(e) An “Eligible Stockholder” is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of
15


both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this section 12, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer (a “Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (e)
,
;
provided
that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this section 12. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this section 12 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder
’
s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on the dates referred to above and through the date of the applicable annual meeting (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).
(f) No later than the final date when a

(A)
(a)
within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person

s Stockholder Nominee(s), and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including but not limited to all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder), or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the Stockholder Nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(4)
a representation that such person:
acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the corporation, and does not presently have such intent;

(D)
(d)
will not distribute to any stockholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the corporation; and
(E)
(e)
will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the corporation and its stockholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this section 12;
(5)

(6)
an undertaking that such person agrees to:
(a)
assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the corporation and each of its directors, officers and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation

In order to be considered timely, any information required by this section 12 to be provided to the corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Stockholder or other person to change or add any proposed Stockholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including
,
without limitation
under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any defect.
(g) The Eligible Stockholder may provide to the Secretary of the corporation, at the time the information required by this section 12 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the corporation
’
s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Stockholder

(2) complete, sign and submit all questionnaires, representations and agreements required by these by-laws and of the corporation
s directors generally, including providing the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(iii) of these by-laws; and

without limitation
under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any such defect.
(i) Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the corporation

s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of stockholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this section 12 or any other provision of the corporation

(5)
if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to be an Eligible Stockholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.
(k) For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph (j), clauses (1), (2) and (3) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Stockholder Nominee, clause (4), will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to be nominated;
provided
,
however
, that clause (5) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (4), will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Stockholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible Stockholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of all of the applicable stockholder

Not later than (i) 4:00 p.m. (London time) at least four Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, (ii) 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction in Dollars or (iii) 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the Company shall notify the Agent, either on its own behalf or on behalf of a Borrowing Subsidiary, of such Borrower’s acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
Section 2.4.5
;
provided, however,
that the failure by the Company to give such notice to the Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice (a “
Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice
”) shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Company may accept or reject any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part (subject to the terms of
Section 2.4.4(b)(iv)
);
provided
that:
(a) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request,
(b) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, and
Page 27


(c) the Company may not accept any offer that is described in
Section 2.4.4(c)
or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement.
2.4.7
Allocation by Agent
. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples, not greater than $1,000,000 (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers;
provided, however,
that no Lender shall be allocated a portion of any Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum amount which such Lender has indicated that it is willing to accept. Allocations by the Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day in the case of Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances, and by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) in the case of Absolute Rate Advances, notify each Lender of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Lender.
Section 2.5
Method of Borrowing
. Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Chicago to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to
Article XIV
if such Loan is denominated in Dollars. Not later than noon (local time in the city of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency in the city of and at the address of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to
if such Loan is denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars. The Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the applicable Borrower at the Agent’s aforesaid address if denominated in Dollars, and at an account of the applicable Borrower in the relevant jurisdiction and designated by the Company in the applicable Ratable Borrowing Notice or Competitive Bid Quote Request, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars.
Section 2.6
Commitment Fee; Reduction and Increase of Aggregate Commitment; Extension of Termination Date
.
(a)
Commitment Fee
. The Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereby jointly and severally agree to pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a commitment fee (the “
”) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the daily average unused amount of the Commitments, which fee shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day following the last day of March, June, September and December of each year commencing on June 30, 2016 and with a final payment due and payable on the Termination Date. For the purposes of determining the amount of the Commitment Fee, outstanding Competitive Bid Loans shall be deemed not to be a usage of the Commitments.
Page 28


(b)
Reductions in Aggregate Commitment
. The Borrowers may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in a minimum aggregate amount of $25,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), ratably among the Lenders, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction,
provided, however,
that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the outstanding Advances. All accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and on the final date upon which all Loans are repaid hereunder. The Aggregate Commitment once reduced as provided in this
Section 2.6(b)
may only be reinstated as specifically provided in
Section 2.6(c)
below. If (i) any Lender notifies the Company in accordance with
Section 3.5(d)
or (ii) a Borrower reasonably determines that it is or will be required to make any additional payment to any Lender under
Sections 3.1
or
3.2
, then the Company may, at any time thereafter (
provided
that no Default or Unmatured Default then exists and no satisfactory solution has been reached pursuant to
Section 3.6
) and by not less than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent, cancel such Lender’s Commitment, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be obliged to make further Loans hereunder and its Commitment shall be reduced to zero. Upon termination of such Lender’s Commitment, each applicable Borrower shall, subject to the last sentence of this
, pay all outstanding Obligations owing to such Lender. Any notice of cancellation given pursuant to this
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date upon which such cancellation is to take effect. Notwithstanding any such cancellation, the obligations of the Company under
,
and
10.6
shall survive any such cancellation and be enforceable by such Lender. In any case described in
clauses (b)(i)
through
(b)(iii)
above in which the Company has the right to cancel a Lender’s Commitment, the Company may, in connection with such cancellation, arrange for a sale (at par) of such Commitment and all outstanding Loans held by such Lender pursuant to the terms of
Section 13.3
and such Lender will promptly enter into any such sale arranged by the Company.
(c)
Increase in Aggregate Commitment
. (i) The Company may at any time propose that the Aggregate Commitment be increased (the amount of such increase being a “
Commitment Increase
”), effective as at a date prior to the Termination Date and at least 15 days after the Company proposes any such increase to the Agent in writing (an “
Increase Date
”) as to which agreement is to be reached by an earlier date specified in such notice (a “
Commitment Date
”);
that (A) the Company may not propose more than two Commitment Increases in any calendar year, (B) the Company may not propose more than five Commitment Increases pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the minimum proposed Commitment Increase per notice shall be $10,000,000, (D) in no event shall the Aggregate Commitment hereunder at any time exceed $4,500,000,000, and (E) no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Increase Date. The Agent shall notify the Lenders thereof promptly upon its receipt of any such notice. The Agent agrees that it will cooperate with the Company in discussions with the Lenders and other lending institutions with a view to arranging the proposed Commitment Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or more of the Lenders (each such Lender that is willing to increase its Commitment hereunder being an “
Increasing Lender
”) and/or through Commitments provided by one or more Assuming Lenders;
that it shall be in each Lender’s sole discretion whether to increase its Commitment hereunder in connection with the proposed Commitment Increase; and
provided further
that the
Page 29


minimum Commitment of each Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 2.6(c)
shall be at least equal to $10,000,000. If agreement is reached on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date with any Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders as to a Commitment Increase (which may be less than but not greater than specified in the applicable notice from the Company), such agreement to be evidenced by a notice in reasonable detail from the Company to the Agent on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date, such Assuming Lenders, if any, shall become Lenders hereunder as of the applicable Increase Date and the Commitments of such Increasing Lenders and such Assuming Lenders shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the Increase Date, the amounts specified in such notice;
provided
that:
(x) the Agent shall have received (with copies for each Lender, including each such Assuming Lender) by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date a certificate of a Financial Officer, stating that the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions authorizing the Company to borrow money pursuant to this Agreement from time to time in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding in an amount at least equal to the Aggregate Commitment, after giving effect to the pending Commitment Increase, and that such resolutions remain in full force and effect and have not been modified or rescinded or attaching and certifying, if applicable, any amendments to such resolutions or supplemental borrowing resolutions (together with a similar certificate from an authorized officer of each Borrowing Subsidiary, if any are then parties to this Agreement);
(y) each such Assuming Lender shall have delivered to the Agent, by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, an appropriate Lender Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit J
hereto (a “
Lender Assumption Agreement
”), duly executed by such Assuming Lender and the Company; and
(z) each such Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent by, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, (A) its existing Ratable Note, if any, and (B) confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased Commitment.
(ii) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice from the Company as to its agreement to a Commitment Increase on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date and each of the actions provided for in
clauses (i)(x)
through
(i)(z)
above shall have occurred prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date to the satisfaction of the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) and the Company of the occurrence of such Commitment Increase and shall record in its records the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and Assuming Lender. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date, make available to the Agent in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.5
(or at such other time as shall be agreed among the Agent, the applicable Lenders and the Company), in same day funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender’s
Page 30


ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the Aggregate Commitment after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (A) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase over (B) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding before giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will, if necessary, promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective applicable Lending Installations in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Ratable Advances owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase.
(iii) In the event that the Agent shall not have received notice from the Company as to such agreement on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date or the Company shall, by notice to the Agent prior to the applicable Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any of the actions provided for above in
clauses (i)(x)
through
(i)(z)
shall not have occurred by 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the such Increase Date, such proposal by the Company shall be deemed not to have been made. In such event, any actions theretofore taken under
above shall be deemed to be of no effect and all the rights and obligations of the parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.
(d)
Extension of Termination Date
. (i) So long as no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may on one occasion, upon at least 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to any annual anniversary of the date hereof, by written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Lender), propose to extend the Termination Date by one year. Each Lender may, not more than 30 days nor less than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, elect by written notice to the Company and the Agent to extend its Termination Date by a period of one year. The Agent will notify the Company, in writing of the Lenders’ decisions no later than 15 days prior to such anniversary date. No Lender (or any successor thereto) shall have any obligation to extend its Termination Date, and any decision by a Lender to extend its Termination Date shall be made in its sole discretion independently from any other Lender. Any Lender that does not respond to a request to extend the Termination Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender.
(ii) If any Lender shall not elect to extend its Termination Date pursuant to
paragraph (i)
above (each such Lender being a “
Non-Consenting Lender
”), the Company may designate another bank or other financial institution (which shall either be an Assuming Lender or may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Lenders) which at the time agrees to accept an assignment of the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender in accordance with
Section 13.3
;
provided
,
however
, that (A) any Assuming Lender at the time of the applicable assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent a lender assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; (B) the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result
Page 31


of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $5,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; (C) any such Non-Consenting Lender shall have been paid (x) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender plus (y) any accrued but unpaid commitment fees owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (D) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and (E) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under
Section 13.3
for such assignment shall have been paid. To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.6(d)
and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with this
paragraph (ii)
, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Company, such Lender or any other Person;
provided
that such Non-Consenting Lender’s rights under
Article III
,
Section 10.6
and
Article XI
(solely with respect to indemnification obligations set forth therein), shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.
(iii) If (after giving effect to any assignments pursuant to
of this
) Lenders having Commitments equal to at least 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable anniversary date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an assignment agreement pursuant to
or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such anniversary date, the Agent shall so notify the Company, and so long as no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and then be continuing (and the Company shall have so certified to the Agent) on the proposed effective date of such execution, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in
paragraph (i)
, and all references in this Agreement and in the Notes to the “Termination Date” shall, with respect to each Lender other than a Non-Consenting Lender for such extension, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each extension of the Termination Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto.
Section 2.7
Minimum Amount of Each Advance
. Each Eurocurrency Ratable Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), and each Floating Rate Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars);
provided, however,
that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment. Each Competitive Bid Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof). No Borrower shall request a Fixed Rate Advance if, after giving effect to the requested Fixed Rate Advance, more than 12 separate Fixed Rate Advances would be outstanding.
Page 32


Section 2.8
Optional Principal Payments
. Each Borrower may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances, upon one Business Day’s prior notice to the Agent. Each Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4
but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances upon three Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent. A Competitive Bid Loan may not be paid prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period.
Section 2.9
Changes in Interest Rate, etc
. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.3.4
, to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance pursuant to
hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance. No Interest Period may end after the Termination Date.
Section 2.10
Rate After Maturity
. Except as provided in the next sentence, any
Dollar-denominated
Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate plus 2% per annum, payable upon demand. Any Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars that is not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest until paid at the rate applicable thereto plus 2% per annum, payable upon demand. In the case of a
Fixed Rate Advance the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period (or until paid if paid prior to the end of such Interest Period), at the higher of the rate otherwise applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance for such Interest Period plus 2% per annum or the Floating Rate plus 2% per annum. In the case of a Fixed Rate Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period (or until paid if paid prior to the end of such Interest Period) at the rate otherwise applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance for such Interest Period plus 2% per annum.
Page 33


Section 2.11
Method of Payment
. (a) Each Advance shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such Advance was made or, where such currency has converted to the Euro, in the Euro. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Agent at (except as set forth in the next sentence) the Agent’s address specified pursuant to
Article XIV
, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrowers, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. All payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in any currency other than Dollars shall be made in such currency on the date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency for the account of the Agent, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at (i) with respect to Floating Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, its address specified pursuant to
or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender and (ii) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, in the funds received from the Borrowers at the address of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
, if, after the making of any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Advance was made (the “
Original Currency
”) no longer exists or the Borrowers are not able to make payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. For purposes of this
Section 2.11(b)
, the participation by any country in the third stage of the European Economic and Monetary Union shall not constitute the imposition of currency control or exchange regulations.
Section 2.12
Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness
. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made to each Borrower hereunder, the Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from each Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.
Page 34


(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (a)
and
(b)
above shall be
prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
provided, however,
that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
(d) Any Lender may request that its Ratable Loans or its Competitive Bid Loans be evidenced by Ratable Notes or Competitive Bid Notes, respectively. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Ratable Note or a Competitive Bid Note, as the case may be, payable to such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 13.3
) be represented by a Note payable to the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in
above.
Section 2.13
Telephonic Notices
. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances denominated in Dollars, effect selections of Types of Advances denominated in Dollars, submit Competitive Bid Quotes for Advances denominated in Dollars and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of such Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Conversion/Continuation Notices and Competitive Bid Quote Requests for Advances denominated in Dollars to be given telephonically. Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by a Financial Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 2.14
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest on Loans and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year,
except
that interest on Floating Rate Loans shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year or 366 day year, as the case may be, and interest on Loans denominated in British Pounds Sterling or by reference to the CDOR Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year (or 366 days in a leap year). Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
Page 35


Section 2.15
Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Ratable Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
Section 2.16
Lending Installations
. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with
Article XIV
, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
Section 2.17
Non-Receipt
of Funds by the Agent
. Unless a Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
Section 2.18
Borrowing Subsidiaries
. The Company may at any time or from time to time, with the consent of the Agent and each Lender, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, add as a party to this Agreement any Subsidiary to be a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder by the execution and delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Assumption Letter by such Subsidiary, with the written consent of the Company at the foot thereof. Upon such execution, delivery and consent such Subsidiary shall for all purposes be a party hereto as a Borrowing Subsidiary as fully as if it had executed and delivered this Agreement. So long as the principal of and interest on any Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been repaid or paid in full and all other obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been fully performed, the Company may, by not less than five Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate such Borrowing Subsidiary’s status as a “Borrowing Subsidiary”.
Page 36


Section 2.19
Market Disruption
. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in
Article II
and
Article IV
with respect to any Advance in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Ratable Loans comprising such Advance to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrowers, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in
Section 2.1.1
, be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, as Floating Rate Loans, unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (a) it elects not to borrow on such date or (b) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be.
Section 2.20
Judgment Currency
. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrowers hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “
specified currency
”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Agent’s main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that on which final,
non-appealable
judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 13.2
, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrowers.
Section 2.21
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)
; and
Page 37


(b) the Commitment and principal amount of the outstanding Advances of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.2
);
provided
, that this
clause (b)
shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby.
The Agent shall provide written notice to any Lender determined by the Agent to be a Defaulting Lender hereunder (and the Agent shall provide a copy of such determination to the Company). In the event that the Agent and the Company agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, if any Loans are outstanding on such date, such Lender shall purchase, at par plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, such of the Loans of the other Lenders or a portion of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its applicable Commitment percentage.

. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law:
(a) subjects any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b)
through
(d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or
(b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or
(c) imposes any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Fixed Rate Loans, or requires any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Fixed Rate Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Recipient,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Fixed Rate Loans or Commitment, then, within 15 days of demand by such Recipient, the Borrowers shall pay such Recipient such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
Page 38


Section 3.2
Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations
. (a) If a Lender determines the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change in Law, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender’s policies as to capital adequacy and liquidity).
(b) If, after the date hereof, any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or any Floating Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Agent and the Agent shall promptly give notice to the Company and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Company that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans or Floating Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate, and the right of the Company to convert any Loan to a Eurocurrency Loan or continue any Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan or a Floating Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be suspended and thereafter the Company may select only Floating Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate hereunder, (ii) all Floating Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a Eurocurrency Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Floating Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period.
Section 3.3
Availability of Types of Advances
. If (a) any Lender determines that maintenance of its Eurocurrency Ratable Loans or Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, (b) if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type, currency and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency Ratable Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Ratable Advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Ratable Advances, or (c) if the Agent shall determine that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate (including, without limitation, by means of an Interpolated Rate) or the LIBOR Market Rate Spread, then the Agent shall, in the case of
clause (a)
above, suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Ratable Advances and Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances and require any affected Eurocurrency Ratable Advances and Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4
, and, in the case of
clause (b)
or
(c)
above, suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Ratable Advances and require any affected Eurocurrency Ratable Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
;
provided
, that in each case above, all Advances denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars must be repaid.
Page 39


Section 3.4
Funding Indemnification
. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate Advance is not made on the date specified by the requesting Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Fixed Rate Advance.
Section 3.5
Taxes
.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers
. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
(c)
Evidence of Payments

, such Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
(d)
Indemnification by the Borrowers

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Page 40


(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 13.2.4
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this
paragraph (e)
.
(f)
Status of Lenders

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will enable the Company or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that each Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-2 or Exhibit K-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
Page 42


(D) if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D)
, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this
Section 3.5
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this
paragraph (g)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)
Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.
Page 43


Section 3.6
Mitigation of Additional Costs or Adverse Circumstances
. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in:
(a) an increase in the liability of a Borrower to such Lender under
Section 3.1
,
3.2
or
3.5
(b) the unavailability of a Type of Ratable Loan under
Section 3.3
;
then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the applicable Borrower’s obligations under any of the clauses referred to above in this
, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Company and to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to its own position, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, (i) the transfer of its Loans to a Lending Installation in another jurisdiction, (ii) the assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity willing to participate in this facility or (iii) the restructure of its participation in this facility in a manner which will avoid the event in question and on terms mutually acceptable to such Lender, the Agent and the Company). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to the Company to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, or if any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, such Lender shall be obliged, at the written request of the Company, to assign all its rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.1
and
) and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity nominated by the Company with the approval of the Agent and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender;
provided
that such other bank or entity satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by
Sections 3.5(f)
13.3.3
. Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Company under
10.6
shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender.
Section 3.7
Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under
or to avoid the unavailability of Eurocurrency Ratable Advances under
, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
3.4
. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurocurrency Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurocurrency Rate or Eurocurrency Bid Rate, as the case may be, applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not;
, that such Lender need not disclose any information that is confidential or to the extent prohibited by law or regulation. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Article III
, no Borrower shall be required to make any payments to any Lender pursuant to
with respect to periods of time more than 90 days prior to the date upon which such Lender’s written statement in accordance with the terms of this
is first delivered to the applicable Borrower.

Section 9.8
Foreign Currency
. The specification of payment in a specific currency at a specific place and time pursuant to this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document is essential.

In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, does not result in payment of the amount of currency due under this guaranty, upon conversion to the currency of account and transfer to the place specified for payment, the Agent and the Lenders shall have an independent cause of action against the Company for the deficiency.

The bank serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Agent hereunder.
The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether an Unmatured Default or Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 8.2
), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Unmatured Default or Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in

Page 66


The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article XI
and
Article X
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents,
provided
that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to
Section 3.5(g)
shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

Page 67


appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.6
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrowers and their Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Lenders designated as the Syndication Agents shall have no duties or responsibilities and such Lenders shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any other Lender, and no implied responsibilities, duties or obligations shall be construed to exist in this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Exhibit G
to the extent necessary so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of any Borrower to a Lender other than Indebtedness comprised of Loans made by such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness comprised of the Loans.

Section 3.1
or
than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrowers, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation, (b) such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Section 3.6

Participant Register
. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “
”);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
Section 13.3
Assignments
.
13.3.1
Permitted Assignments
. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities other than Ineligible Institutions (“
Purchasers
”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit G
or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrowers and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000;
, that (i) the foregoing consent of the Borrowers shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) each Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof. The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the “Trade Date,” if the “Trade Date” is specified in the assignment.
13.3.2
Consents
. The consent of the Borrowers shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund,
provided,
that (i) the consent of the Borrowers shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) each Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof. The consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless (x) the Purchaser is a Lender or (y) solely to the extent the assignor is a Person that was a Lender on the Closing Date, the Purchaser is an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund. Any consent required under this
Section 13.3.2
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

13.3.3
Effect; Effective Date
. Upon (a) delivery to the Agent of an assignment (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating such an assignment by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Agent and the parties to such assignment are participants), together with any consents required by
Sections 13.3.1
and
13.3.2
, (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless the Purchaser is an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or such fee is waived by the Agent) and (c) the delivery by the Purchaser to the Agent of an Administrative Questionnaire, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes “plan assets” as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be “plan assets” under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
Section 13.3
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 13.2
. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 13.3.3
, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.
13.3.4
Register
. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
”). In the absence of manifest error, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Section 13.4
Dissemination of Information
. Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “
Transferee
”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession concerning the creditworthiness of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries;
provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by
Section 10.11
of this Agreement.
Page 72


Section 13.5
Tax Treatment
. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of
Section 3.5
.

FORM OF COMPANY OPINION
May [ ], 2016
The Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the
Agreement described below.
Gentlemen/Ladies:
I am counsel for Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “
Company
”), and have represented the Company in connection with its execution and delivery of the Five Year Credit Agreement among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, individually and as Agent, and the Lenders named therein, providing for Advances in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding, as of the date hereof, $2,500,000,000 at any one time outstanding (with provisions therein allowing for an increase in the maximum amount of Advances thereunder to $4,500,000,000, subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth therein) and dated as of May 9, 2016 (the “
Agreement
”). All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.
I have examined the Company’s certificate of incorporation,
by-laws,
resolutions, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact and law which I deem necessary in order to render this opinion. Based upon the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. The Company and each domestic Material Subsidiary are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their states of incorporation and have all requisite authority to conduct their business in each jurisdiction in which their business is conducted, except where the failure to have such authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
2. The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Company and the performance by the Company of the Obligations have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Company and will not:
(a) require any consent of the Company’s shareholders;
(b) violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Company or the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or
by-laws
or, to my knowledge, any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Company; or
(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien pursuant to the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement known to me and binding upon the Company which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Exhibit B-1 - 1


3. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies, regardless of whether enforcement is sought at equity or at law.
4. There is no litigation or proceeding against the Company which, to my knowledge, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5. No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of any Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained by the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement or in connection with the payment by the Company of the Obligations.
With respect to the opinions set forth in paragraph number 3 above:
