Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:

You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services (“Fidelity”) or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Fidelity and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan.

Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant options or other equity awards to you or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

APPENDIX B
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the option agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your option if you reside in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the option agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the options were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2016. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your option vests, you exercise your option, or you sell shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the option was granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

AUSTRALIA
Terms and Conditions
In addition, the option will automatically expire in the event the option has not become exercisable pursuant to the preceding paragraph with six years and 11 months following the grant date.
Breach of Law
. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or the option agreement, you will not be entitled to, and shall not claim any benefit (including without limitation a legal right) under the Plan if the provision of such benefit would give rise to a breach of Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), any other provision of that Act, or any other applicable statute, rule or regulation which limits or restricts the giving of such benefits. Further, the Employer is under no obligation to seek or obtain the approval of its shareholders in a general meeting for the purpose of overcoming any such limitation or restriction.
Notifications
Securities Law Information
. You understand that if you acquire shares upon exercise of the option and subsequently offer the shares for sale to a person or entity resident in Australia, the offer may be subject to disclosure requirements under Australian law. You are advised to obtain legal advice regarding any applicable disclosure requirements prior to making any such offer.
GERMANY
Exchange Control Information
. Cross-border payments in excess of €12,500 must be reported electronically monthly to the German Federal Bank. In the event that you make or receive a payment in excess of this amount, you are responsible for obtaining the appropriate form from the remitting bank and complying with the applicable reporting obligations.
SPAIN
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation
. By accepting the option, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the grant of the options, your termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement (including for the reasons listed below) will automatically result in the forfeiture of any options that have not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the option agreement, the option will be forfeited without entitlement to the underlying shares or to any amount as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including but not limited to: resignation, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause; disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); individual or collective layoff on

objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause; material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute; relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute; Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute; unilateral withdrawal by the Employer; and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant the option under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the option agreement. Consequently, you understand that the option is granted on the assumption and condition that the option and the shares underlying the option shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the option would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of options shall be null and void.
Notifications
Securities Law Information
. The option described in the option agreement and Appendix A and B do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The option agreement (including Appendix A and B) has not been nor will it be registered with the
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores
, and it does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information
. Spanish residents must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of stock in a foreign company (including shares acquired under the Plan) to the Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, for statistical purposes. Generally, the declaration must be made in January for shares acquired or sold during (or owned as of December 31 of) the prior year; however, if the value of shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or the Spanish resident holds 10% or more of the shares capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect, the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her

11


foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (e.g., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.
UNITED KINGDOM
Terms and Conditions
Tax and National Insurance Contributions Acknowledgment
. The following provisions supplement paragraph (k) of the option agreement:
If payment or withholding of income taxes is not made within ninety (90) days after the end of the U.K. tax year in which the taxable event occurs, or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), you understand and agree that the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a loan owed by you to the Employer, effective on the Due Date. You understand and agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”), it will be immediately due and repayable by you, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in paragraph (l) of the option agreement. You also authorize the Company to delay the issuance of any shares to you unless and until the loan is repaid in full.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), you will not be eligible for such a loan to cover the income tax. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, you understand that the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (“NICs”) may be payable. You understand and agree that you will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Employer (as appropriate) for the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Employer may recover from you by any of the means referred to in paragraph (1) of the option agreement.

(f) Waiver. You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this RSU agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this RSU agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any other Participant.

Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the RSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

Notifications
Securities Law Information. You will not be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares acquired under the Plan within Canada. You are permitted to sell shares acquired under the Plan only through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided that the resale of such shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the shares are listed (i.e., the NYSE).
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Canadian residents are required to report their foreign property on Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total cost of their foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Foreign property includes cash held outside of Canada and shares acquired under the Plan, and it includes unvested RSU. RSU must be reported – generally at a nil cost – if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because other foreign property is held by you. The Form T1135 must be filed by April 30 of the following year. When shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the shares. The ACB ordinarily would equal the fair market value of the shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other shares of the same company, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should consult with your personal tax advisor to determine your reporting requirements.
CHINA
Terms and Conditions
Settlement of RSU. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of the RSU agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, the RSU will be paid in cash at vesting and not in shares.

The cash payment will be made by the Employer and will be paid to you in local currency through your local payroll. The cash payment will be subject to all applicable tax withholding and reporting. To convert the payment amount from US dollars into local currency, the Company will use an exchange rate determined pursuant to the Company’s financial policies in effect on the payment date.

By signing the Form K, the broker/bank undertakes an obligation, without further request each year and not later than February 1 of the year following the calendar year to which the information relates, to forward information to the Danish Tax Administration concerning the content of the account. In the event that the applicable financial institution (broker or bank) with which the account is held, does not wish to, or, pursuant to the laws of the country in question, is not allowed to assume such obligation to report, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for providing certain details regarding the foreign brokerage or bank account to the Danish Tax Administration as part of your annual income tax return.

Data Privacy. This section supplements paragraph (c) of Appendix A to the RSU agreement:
By accepting the RSU, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to the terms regarding the collection, processing and transfer of data described in paragraph (c) of Appendix A to the RSU agreement. In this regard, upon request of the Company or the Employer, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form or any similar agreements or consents that the Company or the Employer may deem necessary to obtain under the data privacy laws in Russia, either now or in the future.

Exchange Control Information. Russian residents are required to repatriate proceeds from the sale of shares received in relation to the RSU to the resident’s bank account in Russia prior to using those proceeds for any purpose, including reinvestment. Such funds must initially be credited to you through a foreign currency account at an authorized bank in Russia. After the funds are initially received in Russia, they may be further remitted to foreign banks in accordance with Russian exchange control laws.
As an express statutory exception to the above-mentioned repatriation rule, cash dividends paid on the shares can be paid directly to a foreign bank or brokerage account opened with a bank located in an OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) or FATF (Financial Action Task Force) country. As of January 1, 2018, cash proceeds from the sale of shares listed on one of the foreign stock exchanges on the list provided for by the Russian Federation law “On the Securities Market” (which currently includes the New York Stock Exchange) also can be paid directly to a foreign bank or brokerage account opened with a bank located in an OECD or FATF country. Other statutory exceptions may apply.
You should consult your personal advisor before repatriating any sale proceeds to Russia, as significant penalties may apply in the case of non-compliance with exchange control requirements and such requirements are subject to change at any time, often without notice.
Securities Law Information. The Plan, the RSU agreement (including Appendix A and B), and all other materials that you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia. Absent any requirement under local law, the issuance of securities pursuant to the Plan has not and will not be registered in Russia; therefore, the securities described in any Plan-related documents may not be used for offering or public circulation in Russia.
Depending on the development of local regulatory requirements, the Company reserves the right to force the immediate sale of any shares to be issued upon vesting and settlement of the RSU. If applicable, you agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such shares (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization), and you expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such shares. You acknowledge that the Company’s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the shares at any particular price. Upon the sale of the shares, the Company agrees to pay you the cash proceeds from the sale of the shares, less any brokerage fees or commissions and subject to any obligation to satisfy Tax-Related Items. You acknowledge that you are not aware of any material nonpublic information with respect to the Company or any securities of the Company as of the date of this RSU agreement.

Anti-Corruption Information. Anti-corruption laws prohibit certain public servants, their spouses and their dependent children from owning any foreign source financial instruments (e.g., shares of foreign companies such as the Company). Accordingly, you should inform the Company if you are covered by these laws because you should not hold shares acquired under the Plan.

Terms and Conditions
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation. By accepting the RSU, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the grant of the RSU, your termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement (including for the reasons listed below) will automatically result in the forfeiture of any RSU that have not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the RSU agreement, the RSU will be forfeited without entitlement to the underlying shares or to any amount as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including, but not limited to: resignation, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective layoff on objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute, Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by the Employer, and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant RSU under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the RSU agreement. Consequently, you understand that the RSU are granted on the assumption and condition that the RSU and the shares underlying the RSU shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the RSU would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of RSU shall be null and void.

Securities Law Information. The RSU described in the RSU agreement and Appendix A and B do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The RSU agreement (including Appendix A and B) has not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and it does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information. Spanish residents must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of stock in a foreign company (including shares acquired under the Plan) to the Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, for statistical purposes. Generally, the declaration must be made in January for shares acquired or sold during (or owned as of December 31 of) the prior year; however, if the value of shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or the Spanish resident holds 10% or more of the shares capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the

In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect, the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (e.g., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the PRSU agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your PRSUs if you reside and/or work in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the PRSU agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the PRSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2016. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your PRSU vests or you sell shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the PRSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

institute any claim against the Company or the Employer and you irrevocably waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims;

You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all LTI CASH grants and any entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services (“Fidelity”) or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Fidelity and any other possible recipients which may

assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, request access to Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant LTI CASH or other equity awards to you or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

APPENDIX B
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the LTI CASH agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your LTI CASH grant if you reside in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the LTI CASH agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the LTI CASH award was granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2016. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your LTI CASH grant vests or you receive cash under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the LTI CASH grant is made or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation
. By accepting the LTI CASH grant, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the LTI CASH grant, your termination of employment for any reason (including for the reasons listed below) other than death, disability or retirement will automatically result in the forfeiture of any LTI CASH grants that were not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the LTI CASH agreement, the LTI CASH grant will be forfeited without entitlement to any cash payment as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including but not limited to: resignation; disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause; disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); individual or collective layoff on objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause; material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute; relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute; Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute; unilateral withdrawal by the Employer; and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
You also understand that this LTI CASH grant would not be made but for the assumptions and conditions set forth above; thus, you understand, acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or any of the conditions not be met for any reason, the LTI CASH grant and any right to a cash payment pursuant to the LTI CASH grant shall be null and void.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion decided to grant LTI CASH awards under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the LTI CASH agreement. Consequently, you understand that the LTI CASH awards are granted on the assumption and condition that the LTI CASH grant and the cash award subject to the LTI CASH grant shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the LTI CASH award would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of LTI CASH shall be null and void.
Notifications
In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect,

the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (e.g., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.
You are solely responsible for complying with any exchange control or other reporting requirement that may apply to you as a result of participation in the Plan or the transfer of funds in connection with the award. You should consult your legal advisor to confirm the current reporting requirements related to the Plan to Spain.
UNITED KINGDOM
Terms and Conditions
Tax and National Insurance Contributions Acknowledgment. The following provisions supplement paragraph (j) of the LTI Cash agreement:
If payment or withholding of income taxes is not made within ninety (90) days after the end of the U.K. tax year in which the taxable event occurs, or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the “Due Date”), you understand and agree that the amount of any uncollected income tax will constitute a loan owed by you to the Employer, effective on the Due Date. You understand and agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”), it will be immediately due and repayable by you, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in paragraph (J) of the LTI CASH agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that if you are a director or executive officer (as within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), you will not be eligible for such a loan to cover the income tax. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, you understand that the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions (“NICs”) may be payable. You understand and agree that you will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Employer (as appropriate) for the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Employer may recover from you by any of the means referred to in paragraph (j) of the LTI CASH agreement.
