On December 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. adopted amendments to Apple’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (as so amended, the “Bylaws”) to implement proxy access. The Bylaws include a new Section 5.15 that permits a shareholder, or a group of up to twenty shareholders, owning at least three percent of Apple’s outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in Apple’s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to twenty percent of the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws.
The Bylaws also include changes to the Advance Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations provisions in Section 5.14 to account for proxy access and a number of ministerial, clarifying and conforming changes to Sections 2.4, 5.4 and 10.6.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
