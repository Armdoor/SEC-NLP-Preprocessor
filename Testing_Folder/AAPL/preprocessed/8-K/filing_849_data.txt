1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Apple’s 2.000% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes,” and, together with the 2024 Notes, the “Notes”).
The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 29, 2013 (the “Indenture”), between Apple and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, together with the officer’s certificate dated as of September 17, 2015 issued pursuant thereto establishing the terms of each series of the Notes (the “Officer’s Certificate”).
