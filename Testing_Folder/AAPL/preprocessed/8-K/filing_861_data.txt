On July 24, 2015, Apple Inc.

The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 29, 2013 (the “Indenture”), between Apple and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, together with the officer’s certificate dated as of July 31, 2015 issued pursuant thereto establishing the terms of each series of the Notes (the “Officer’s Certificate”).
The Notes are being issued pursuant to Apple’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2013 (Reg. No. 333-188191) (the “Registration Statement”).
Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, beginning on January 31, 2016 and on the applicable maturity date for each series of Notes. The 2029 Notes will mature on July 31, 2029, and the 2042 Notes will mature on July 31, 2042.
The Notes will be Apple’s senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with Apple’s other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time outstanding.
