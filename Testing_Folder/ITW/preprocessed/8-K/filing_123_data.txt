Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 5, 2023, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Euro-denominated credit agreement (the “Euro Credit Agreement”) among the Company, the lender(s) party thereto and ING Bank, N.V., London Branch, as Agent. Under the Euro Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to €1,300,000,000, including €300,000,000 of incremental commitment, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Any Loan (as defined in the Euro Credit Agreement) will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the applicable EURIBOR rate (adjusted for any statutory reserves) plus 0.75% for the interest period selected by the Company of one, three or six months; once repaid, in full or in part, a Loan may not be re-borrowed. Accrued and unpaid interest is payable at the end of the applicable interest period selected by the Company, but no less frequently than every three months. The Euro Credit Agreement terminates and all amounts outstanding thereunder are payable on May 3, 2024 (the “Termination Date”); provided, however, that the Company may extend the Termination Date by six months on up to two occasions.
The Euro Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens and merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Euro Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1.
The foregoing description of the Euro Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Euro Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10(a) and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant
