Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 28, 2021
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its 2021 third quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. Operating income and each of the invested capital balances are the GAAP amounts reported in the Company's financial statements. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of operating income as reported in the Company's financial statements less income taxes calculated based on the Company's effective tax rate for the period. For comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefit of $21 million in the third quarter of 2021 and the discrete tax benefit of $112 million in the second quarter of 2021 from the effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2021. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter within each of the periods presented. After-tax ROIC is calculated by dividing operating income after taxes by average invested capital for the period presented, and is annualized for interim periods. A calculation of After-tax ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
