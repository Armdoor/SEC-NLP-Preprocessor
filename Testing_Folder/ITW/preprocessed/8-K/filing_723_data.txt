Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 9, 2016, Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a $2.5 billion, five year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPM”), as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and a syndicate of Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company pays a facility fee that varies between 0.045% and 0.125%, depending on its credit rating. Advances denominated in U.S. Dollars carry, at the Company’s option, either the “base rate” of interest in effect, the “eurocurrency rate,” which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin or a competitive bid rate of interest. Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars carry the “eurocurrency rate” or a competitive bid rate of interest. The “base rate” of interest is the highest of (i) JPM’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% (if one-month LIBOR is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero). The applicable margin includes a market rate spread, which is a rate per annum equal to the five-year credit default swap mid-rate spread. This spread varies between 0.25% and 1.25% depending on the Company’s credit rating.
The Credit Agreement includes a provision under which the Company may request an increase of the total facility up to $4.5 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders’ discretion. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Credit Agreement contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four-quarter period then ended to Total Interest Expense for the same period.
Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, foreign exchange and trust services.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(a) and is incorporated herein by reference.
