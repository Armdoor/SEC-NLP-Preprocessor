Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
(a)
At its December 11, 2015 meeting, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s By-Laws in order to implement “proxy access,” which allows the Company’s eligible stockholders to include their own director nominees in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials under the circumstances set forth in the By-Laws. New Section 12 was added to Article II of the By-Laws and provides that up to 20 stockholders owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock for at least three years may nominate up to the greater of 25% of the Board of Directors or two directors, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. The amended and restated By-Laws approved by the Board became effective immediately upon approval.
The amended and restated By-Laws also include updates to Section 10(c) and Section 11 of Article II to reflect the Company’s implementation of proxy access.
A copy of the Company’s By-laws, as amended and restated and marked to show the changes from the By-Laws immediately prior to the amendments, is included as Exhibit 3(b)(i) hereto. A clean copy of the Company’s
By-Laws,
as amended and restated, is included as Exhibit 3(b)(ii) hereto. The above description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amended and restated
By-Laws
filed as an exhibit to this Report.
