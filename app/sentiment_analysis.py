"""
Purpose:
This file is responsible for analyzing the sentiment or emotion of a given text. Sentiment analysis helps understand 
the emotional tone of the text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), which can be useful for various applications like 
customer feedback analysis or conversational AI.

Concept:

This file will typically use libraries like TextBlob or NLTK to perform sentiment analysis on text.
The sentiment can be measured in terms of polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity (opinion vs fact).
The sentiment score will then be returned as part of the response, which can be used for further analysis or as a 
feature in a user-facing application.
