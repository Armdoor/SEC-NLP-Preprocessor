Item 2.05	Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
In December 2024, TPI Composites, Inc. (the Company) committed to a restructuring plan in order to rationalize its workforce in Türkiye in response to lower forecasted demand in 2025 for wind blades primarily exported by the Company’s customers to the European market. This decline in forecasted demand is primarily attributed to the hyperinflationary environment in Türkiye, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
The Company is reducing its headcount at its Turkish manufacturing facilities by approximately 20%. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize pre-tax charges for severance and other one-time termination benefits in the range of $9 million to $11 million. These charges are expected to be paid in January 2025.
The Company may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur as a result of or in connection with the implementation of the restructuring plan. The Company intends to exclude the charges associated with the restructuring plan from its non-GAAP financial measures.

Forward-looking statements may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
