2.3 Compensation
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and may be reimbursed for expenses, as fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. This
Section
2.3
shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for those services.
2.4 Election and Term of Office
Each director shall be elected to serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal year and until such director’s successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of any incumbent director who fails to be elected by “approval of the shareholders” as defined in Section 153 of the Code in an Uncontested Election (as such term is defined below) and who has not earlier resigned will end on the date that is the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the date on which the voting results are determined pursuant to Section 707 of the Code and (b) the date on which the Board of Directors selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with the procedures set forth in

Section 5.14
regarding advance notice and (y)
Section 5.15
regarding proxy access, the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election.
2.5 Vacancies and Resignations
(a) A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist (i) in the event of the death, resignation or removal of any director, (ii) if the authorized number of directors is increased, (iii) if the shareholders fail, at any meeting of shareholders at which any director or directors are elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be elected at that meeting, (iv) if the Board of Directors declares vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony, or (v) at the end of the term of an incumbent director who fails to be elected by approval of the shareholders as set forth in
2.4
.
(b) Except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in
2.7
, a vacancy may be filled by approval of the board, or if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum by (i) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, or (iii) a sole remaining director. Vacancies created by the removal of a director shall be filled only by approval of the shareholders or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote.
(c) The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by removal, shall require the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. A director may not be elected by written consent to fill a vacancy created by removal except by unanimous consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
3


(d) Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.

A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director’s term of office.

If there is more than one Lead Director, the Board of Directors may prescribe different responsibilities to each Lead Director.
2.7 Removal
The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation, the provisions of this
Section
2.7
shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

5.3
(such request, a “
Special Meeting Request
”). The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule, or cancel any previously scheduled special meeting of shareholders called pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) for any reason.
No shareholder may submit a Special Meeting Request without first submitting a request in proper written form to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation that the Board of Directors fix a record date for determining shareholders entitled to submit a Special Meeting Request pursuant to clause (ii) of this
5.3(a)

Requested Record Date

, the term “
Solicited Shareholder

Subject to
5.3(g)

, the shareholder or shareholders that submitted a Special Meeting Request shall update the information previously provided to the Corporation in connection with the Special Meeting Request so that the information provided or required to be provided in such Special Meeting Request is true and correct as of the record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to the special meeting or any adjournment, postponement, or rescheduling thereof, and such update shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time (the “
close of business

For the avoidance of doubt, any information provided pursuant to this
5.3(e)
shall not be deemed to cure any deficiencies in a Special Meeting Request previously delivered pursuant to this
5.3
. If the shareholder or shareholders that submitted a Special Meeting Request fail to provide any written update in accordance with this
, the information as to which such written update relates may be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this

The shareholder or shareholders requesting a Requested Record Date or submitting a Special Meeting Request shall notify the Secretary in writing at the principal executive offices of the Corporation of any inaccuracy or change in any information submitted within two (2) business days after becoming aware of such inaccuracy or change. Upon written request of the Secretary on behalf of the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), such shareholder or shareholders requesting a Requested Record Date or submitting a Special Meeting Request shall provide, within seven (7) business days after delivery of such request (or such longer period as may be specified in such request), (i) written verification, reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors, any committee thereof, or any authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted and (ii) a written affirmation of any information submitted as of an earlier date. If the shareholder or shareholders requesting a Requested Record Date or submitting a Special Meeting Request fail to provide such written verification or affirmation within such period, the information as to which written verification or affirmation was requested may be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this
.
(g) If the Board of Directors determines (i) that any request to fix a Requested Record Date or any Special Meeting Request (A) relates to an item of business proposed to be transacted at the special meeting that is not a proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law, (B) includes an item of business proposed to be transacted at such meeting that did not appear on the written request that resulted in the determination of the Requested Record Date, or (C) was made in a manner that involved a violation of the Exchange Act or otherwise does not comply with applicable law or (ii) that any shareholder making a request to fix a Requested Record Date or making a Special Meeting Request has not otherwise complied with this
, then the Board of Directors shall not accept, and shall consider ineffective, any such request and shall not be required to fix such Requested Record Date or the Chair of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, or Secretary, as applicable, shall not be required to cause notice to be given to shareholders entitled to vote that a special meeting has been requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, respectively.

(h) Any shareholder may revoke its signature or consent to a Special Meeting Request by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at any time prior to the special meeting. If one or more written revocations have been delivered to the Secretary and the result after giving effect to all revocations is that shareholders holding less than the Requisite Percentage have delivered a Special Meeting Request to the Secretary, then, (i) if the notice of meeting has not already been mailed to shareholders, the Secretary shall refrain from mailing the notice of the special meeting, and (ii) if the notice of meeting has already been mailed to shareholders, the Secretary shall revoke the notice of the meeting.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, the Board of Directors may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at a special meeting called pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section
5.3(a)
. Nothing contained in this
5.3
shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of shareholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.
5.4 Notice of Meetings
Notice of any meeting of shareholders shall be given in writing not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that duty, or if there is no such officer or person, or in case of such officer’s or person’s neglect or refusal, by any director or shareholder. The notice shall state the place, if any, date, and hour of the meeting and (a) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (b) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action except as otherwise provided by Section 601(f) of the Code. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees intended at the time of the notice to be presented by the Board of Directors for election. If the meeting is to be held in whole or in part by electronic transmission by and to the Corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, the notice shall state the means of electronic transmission by and to the Corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which shareholders may participate in the meeting.
5.5 Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice
Written notice shall be given by the Corporation to any shareholder, either (a) personally or (b) by mail or other means of written communication (including electronic transmission by the Corporation), charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder’s physical or electronic address appearing on the books of the Corporation or given by such shareholder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder gives no address or no such address appears on the books of the Corporation, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication addressed to the place where the principal executive office of the Corporation is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such office is located. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit of delivery or mailing, or other authorized means of transmitting, of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this
5.5
, executed by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the Corporation is returned to the Corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of the Corporation for a period of one (1) year from the date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders. Any notice by electronic transmission by the Corporation shall be given subject to applicable provisions under the Code.

5.6 Consent to Shareholders’ Meetings
The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, provides a waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents, or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, except as provided in Section 601(f) of the Code.
5.7 Quorum
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the meeting has been enjoined or if for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum or, if required by the Code, the vote of a greater number or voting by classes.
5.8 Adjourned Meetings
Any shareholders’ meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time, either by the chair of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in
Section
5.7
, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting. When any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if its time and place (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the Corporation, electronic video screen communication, conference telephone, or other means of remote communication, if any, by which the shareholders may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. When a meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business which might have been properly transacted at the original meeting.
14


5.9 Record Date for Shareholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any other action. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of shareholders, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or the Code. In the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable statute relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share.
(b) A determination of the shareholders of record entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days from the date set for the original meeting.
(c) If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and
(ii) the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to give consent to a corporate action in writing without a meeting (1) when no prior action by the Board of Directors has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given, or (2) when prior action by the Board of Directors has been taken, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the sixtieth (60th) day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later.
5.10 Action by Written Consent
(a) Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be provided by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
(b) Any shareholder seeking an action by written consent must first submit a request in proper written form to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation that the Board of Directors fix a record date for determining shareholders entitled to express consent to an action in writing without a meeting pursuant to this
Section
5.10
(a “
Consent Record Date
”). To be in proper written form, such request shall be submitted, signed, and dated by a shareholder of record of the Corporation, shall comply with this
, and shall set forth, as to each Proposing Person, proposed item of business and proposed director nominee, as applicable, all information, statements, questionnaires, representations, and acknowledgements required to be set forth in a notice under
5.14
as if each matter to be acted upon by written consent were to be considered at an annual meeting of shareholders. Within ten (10) business days after the Secretary receives a request for a Consent Record Date in the proper written form, the Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution fixing a Consent Record Date in accordance with
5.9
, which Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors.
15


(c) The Board of Directors may request that a shareholder requesting a Consent Record Date furnish such additional information as may be reasonably required by the Board of Directors. Such shareholder or shareholders shall provide such additional information within five (5) business days after it has been requested by the Board of Directors.
(d) A shareholder making a request for a Consent Record Date shall update its request so that the information previously provided in such request is true and correct as of the Consent Record Date and such update shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the date that is ten (10) days after the Consent Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any information provided pursuant to this
Section
5.10(d)
shall not be deemed to cure any deficiencies in a request for a Consent Record Date previously delivered pursuant to this
5.10
. If the shareholder that made a request for a Consent Record Date fails to provide any written update in accordance with this
, the information as to which such written update relates may be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this
.
(e) If any information submitted pursuant to this
is inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, such information shall be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this
. The shareholder making a request for a Consent Record Date shall notify the Secretary in writing at the principal executive offices of the Corporation of any inaccuracy or change in any information submitted within two (2) business days after becoming aware of such inaccuracy or change. Upon written request of the Secretary on behalf of the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), such shareholder shall provide, within seven (7) business days after delivery of such request (or such longer period as may be specified in such request), (i) written verification, reasonably satisfactory to the Board of Directors, any committee thereof, or any authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted and (ii) a written affirmation of any information submitted as of an earlier date. If the shareholder making a request for a Consent Record Date fails to provide such written verification or affirmation within such period, the information as to which written verification or affirmation was requested may be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this
to the contrary, the Board of Directors shall not set a Consent Record Date if (i) the request for a Consent Record Date does not comply with this
, (ii) the request for a Consent Record Date relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law, or (iii) the request for a Consent Record Date was made in a manner that involved a violation of the Exchange Act or otherwise does not comply with applicable law. The Board of Directors shall determine in good faith whether the requirements set forth in this
have been satisfied.
(g) If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing, the Secretary shall give prompt notice of any corporate action approved by the shareholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. Such notice shall be given in the manner specified in
5.5
and applicable law.
(h) In the case of approval pursuant to any provision of the Code specified in Section 603(b)(1) of the Code, the notice shall be given at least ten (10) days before the consummation of any action authorized by that approval, unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing.
16


(i) Any shareholder giving a written consent, or the shareholder’s proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by the Corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary, but may not do so thereafter. Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary.
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors; provided that the shareholders may elect a director to fill a vacancy not filled by the Board of Directors, other than a vacancy created by removal, by the written consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, none of the provisions in this
Section
5.10
shall apply to any solicitation of shareholder action by written consent in lieu of a meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall be entitled to solicit shareholder action by written consent in accordance with applicable law.
5.11 Election of Directors
Approval of the shareholders is required to elect a director in any Uncontested Election of directors. In any other election of directors by the shareholders, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect. Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.
5.12 Proxies
(a) Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person’s duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary. No proxy shall be valid (i) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this
5.12
and applicable law or (ii) after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force. Revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy. A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the Corporation.
(b) A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (i) a pledgee; (ii) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such person’s shares in the Corporation to the maker of the proxy; (iii) a creditor or creditors of the Corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued credit to the Corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit; (iv) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the Corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted for; (v) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement; or (vi) a beneficiary of a trust with respect to shares held by the trust. In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it.
17


(c) Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the Corporation or dies, the debt of the Corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement, the voting trust agreement has terminated, or the person ceases to be a beneficiary of the trust. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a transferee of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares or, in the case of uncertificated shares, on the initial transaction statement and written statements.
(d) Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked “abstain,” whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting their shares on the proposal. A proxy marked “abstain” by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal. In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.
(e) Any shareholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other shareholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the Board of Directors.
5.13 Inspectors of Elections
Before any meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the chair of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder’s proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the chair of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder’s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. These inspectors shall:
(a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
(b) receive votes, ballots, or consents;
18


(c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
(d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
(e) determine when the polls shall close;

.
(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or listing standard. Nothing in this

Final Award payouts shall be paid in cash as soon as practicable after the Committee considers the achievement of the Performance Goals and, to the extent applicable, a Participant’s individual performance, unless such payout is deferred in accordance with the Apple Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (or any successor plan thereto).
(d) Tax Withholding. Payment of any Award shall be subject to deduction for any federal, state, local or foreign taxes which the Company believes are or may be required by law to be withheld with respect to an Award under the Plan or any other compensation payable to a Participant, including, without limitation, under any awards held by a Participant under the Company’s employee stock plans. The Company may provide for the payment of any tax liability by withholding from the payout under the Award or the Participant’s salary or by any other methods deemed appropriate by the Committee.
(e) Termination of Service/Leave of Absence. If a Participant terminates service with the Company prior to a payout date, any Awards granted and outstanding will be forfeited unless otherwise determined by the Committee. A Participant who is on a Company-approved leave of absence shall remain eligible to participate in the Plan but may receive a
pro-rated
payout, as determined by the Committee.
SECTION 6. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.
The Committee may at any time and in its sole discretion suspend, amend or terminate the Plan.

SECTION 7. MISCELLANEOUS.
(a)
No Guarantee of Employment. Nothing in this Plan or any Award granted hereunder shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any subsidiary or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate a Participant’s employment at any time.
(b) Not Compensation for Other Plans. Except as otherwise explicitly required under the terms of an employee benefit plan of the Company that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, no Award under this Plan and no amount payable or paid under any Award shall be deemed to be or counted as salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of the Company for the benefit of any Participant.
(c) Compliance with Applicable Laws. The Plan and the grant and payment of Awards are subject to all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required.
(d) Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (except its
choice-of-law
provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal Laws.
(e) Restrictions on Transfer. Awards granted under the Plan are
non-transferable
and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge.
(f) Section 409A. This Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A or an exemption or exclusion therefrom and, with respect to amounts that are subject to Code Section 409A, it is intended that this Plan be administered in all respects in accordance with Code Section 409A. Each payout under any Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A.
(g) Forfeiture and Recoupment. Any Award granted under the Plan will be subject to any provisions of applicable laws providing for the recoupment or clawback of incentive compensation; the terms of any Company recoupment, clawback or similar policy in effect at the time of grant of the Award; and any recoupment, clawback or similar provisions that the Committee may determine.
(h) Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.
(i) Unfunded Plan. The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. Prior to the payout of any Award, nothing contained herein shall give any Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. No amounts awarded or accrued under the Plan shall be funded, set aside, subject to interest payment or otherwise segregated prior to payout of an Award. Any Award payable under the Plan is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive Awards in future years or benefits in lieu of such Awards.
