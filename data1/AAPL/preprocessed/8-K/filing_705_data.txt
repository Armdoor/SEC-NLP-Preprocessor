The Company posted quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion and quarterly net income of $9 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share.

"We are pleased to have generated $16.1 billion in operating cash flow, a new record for the September quarter," said Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO. "We also returned $9.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and have now completed over $186 billion of our capital return program."
Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 first quarter:


	
•	revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion
	
•	gross margin between 38 percent and 38.5 percent
	
•	operating expenses between $6.9 billion and $7 billion
	
•	other income/(expense) of $400 million
	
•	tax rate of 26 percent
Apple's board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of the Company's common stock. The dividend is payable on November 10, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2016.
