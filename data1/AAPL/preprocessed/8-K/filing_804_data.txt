Exhibit 99.1
Apple Reports Record First Quarter Results
iPhone, Apple Watch, Services & Apple TV Drive All-time Record Revenue
Results Produce Record Quarterly Profit of $18.4 Billion
CUPERTINO, California — January 26, 2016 — Apple
®
today announced financial results for its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended December 26, 2015. The Company posted record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion and record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion, or $3.28 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $74.6 billion and net income of $18 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.1 percent compared to 39.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 66 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
“Our team delivered Apple’s biggest quarter ever, thanks to the world’s most innovative products and all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The growth of our Services business accelerated during the quarter to produce record results, and our installed base recently crossed a major milestone of one billion active devices.”
“Our record sales and strong margins drove all-time records for net income and EPS in spite of a very difficult macroeconomic environment,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We generated operating cash flow of $27.5 billion during the quarter, and returned over $9 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends. We have now completed $153 billion of our $200 billion capital return program.”
Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2016 second quarter:


•		revenue between $50 billion and $53 billion
•		gross margin between 39 percent and 39.5 percent
•		operating expenses between $6 billion and $6.1 billion
•		other income/(expense) of $325 million
•		tax rate of 25.5 percent
Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $.52 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2016.
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2016 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PST on January 26, 2016 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

Constant Currency Revenue Growth (Non-GAAP) -1% 18% 17% -4% 19% 8%
(1) Apple calculates non-GAAP constant currency revenue by translating current quarter local currency revenue to U.S. dollars based on prior period average exchange rates. That amount is compared to prior period GAAP revenue to derive non-GAAP constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage). Apple considers non-GAAP constant currency revenue and revenue growth to be useful metrics to investors and management as they facilitate a more useful comparison of current performance to historical performance.

Services Revenue
Apple’s installed base drove over $31 billion in related purchases in FY15, up 23% Y/Y, and almost $9 billion in Q1’16, up 24% Y/Y

Adjustment to Reflect Certain Unrecognized Services Purchases (2) $10.5 $14.3 $4.2
Installed Base Related Purchases $25.3 $31.2 $8.9
Y/Y Change 23% 24%
(1) Amounts exclude $548 million received from a patent infringement lawsuit.
(2) For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, Apple accounts for such purchases on a net basis by recognizing in Services revenue only the commission it retains from each purchase. This non-GAAP adjustment reflects the portion of the gross amounts billed to customers that Apple remits to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners. Apple considers non-GAAP installed base related purchases to be a useful metric for investors and management as it provides a more complete picture of the transactions generated by the installed base.
