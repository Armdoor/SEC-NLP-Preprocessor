Exhibit 99.1
Apple Reports Record Second Quarter Results
Strong performance of iPhone, Mac & App Store drives 27% revenue growth & 40% EPS growth, setting new second quarter records
CUPERTINO, California—April 27, 2015—Apple
®
today announced financial results for its fiscal 2015 second quarter ended March 28, 2015. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $58 billion and quarterly net profit of $13.6 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $45.6 billion and net profit of $10.2 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.8 percent compared to 39.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 69 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
The growth was fueled by record second quarter sales of iPhone
and Mac
and all-time record performance of the App Store
SM
.
“We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we’ve experienced in previous cycles, and we’re off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.”
“The tremendous customer demand for our products and services in the March quarter drove revenue growth of 27 percent and EPS growth of 40 percent,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Cash flow from operations was also outstanding at $19.1 billion.”
Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2015 third quarter:


•		revenue between $46 billion and $48 billion
•		gross margin between 38.5 percent and 39.5 percent
•		operating expenses between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion
•		other income/(expense) of $350 million
•		tax rate of 26.3 percent
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q2 2015 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on April 27, 2015 at
