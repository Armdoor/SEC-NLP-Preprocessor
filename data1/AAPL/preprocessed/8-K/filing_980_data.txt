Item 5.02.	Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(b), (d)
On July 15, 2014, the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. (“Apple”) appointed Susan L. Wagner to the Board concurrently with the retirement of William V. Campbell. Mr. Campbell served on the Audit and Finance Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board.
As a non-employee director, Ms. Wagner receives a $50,000 annual retainer for her service on the Board, paid in quarterly installments, and participates in Apple’s 1997 Director Stock Plan, as amended (the “Director Plan”), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2014 as Exhibit 10.3 to Apple’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 28, 2013. Upon her appointment, Ms. Wagner received an automatic initial grant of 1,646 restricted stock units under the Director Plan. In connection with her appointment, Apple and Ms. Wagner will enter into Apple’s standard indemnification agreement for directors, the form of which was filed with the SEC on July 22, 2009 as Exhibit 10.2 to Apple’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 27, 2009.
There are no transactions between Ms. Wagner and Apple that would be required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
