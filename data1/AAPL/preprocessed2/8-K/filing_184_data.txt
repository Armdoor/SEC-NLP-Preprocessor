EX-99.1
Exhibit 99.1
Update on Supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
CUPERTINO, California — November 6, 2022 —
COVID-19
restrictions have temporarily impacted the primary iPhone
®
14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility is currently operating at significantly reduced capacity. As we have done throughout the
pandemic, we are prioritizing the health and safety of the workers in our supply chain.
We continue to see strong demand for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. However, we now expect lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products.
We are working closely with our supplier to return to normal production levels while ensuring the health and safety of every worker.
