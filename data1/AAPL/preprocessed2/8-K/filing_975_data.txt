[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/EX-99.1_page2_table1.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/EX-99.1_page2_table2.json]
In addition, as a California corporation, the Company is subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the California General Corporation Law (the “CGCL”), which requires it to provide a fairness opinion to its shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed “interested party” reorganization transaction.
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters
Section 317 of the CGCL authorizes a court to award, or a corporation’s board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers who are parties or are threatened to be made parties to any proceeding (with certain exceptions) by reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the proceeding if that person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the person was unlawful.
Section 204 of the CGCL provides that a corporation’s articles of incorporation may not limit the liability of directors (i) for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law, (ii) for acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director, (iii) for any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit, (iv) for acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director’s duty to the corporation or its shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware, or should have been aware, in the ordinary course of performing a director’s duties, of a risk of a serious injury to the corporation or its shareholders, (v) for acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director’s duty to the corporation or its shareholders, (vi) under Section 310 of the CGCL (concerning transactions between corporations and directors or corporations having interrelated directors) or (vii) under Section 316 of the CGCL (concerning directors’ liability for distributions, loans, and guarantees).
Section 204 further provides that a corporation’s articles of incorporation may not limit the liability of directors for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when the provision became effective or any act or omission as an officer, notwithstanding that the officer is also a director or that his or her actions, if negligent or improper, have been ratified by the directors. Further, Section 317 has no effect on claims arising under federal or state securities laws and does not affect the availability of injunctions and other equitable remedies available to a corporation’s shareholders for any violation of a director’s fiduciary duty to the corporation or its shareholders.


In accordance with Section 317, the Articles of the Company limit the liability of a director to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages to the fullest extent permissible under California law. The Articles further authorize the Company to provide indemnification to its agents (including officers and directors), subject to the limitations set forth above. The Bylaws also provide the Company with the power to indemnify corporate agents in accordance with the CGCL.
Pursuant to the authority provided in the Articles and Bylaws, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its executive officers and directors, indemnifying them against certain potential liabilities that may arise as a result of their service to the Company, and providing for certain other protection. The Company also maintains insurance policies which insure its officers and directors against certain liabilities.
The foregoing summaries are necessarily subject to the complete text of the statutes, the Articles, the Bylaws and the agreements referred to above and are qualified in their entirety by reference thereto.
