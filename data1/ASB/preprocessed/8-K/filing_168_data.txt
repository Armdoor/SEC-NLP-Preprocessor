Associated Banc-Corp Reports First Quarter 2024 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $78 Million, or $0.52 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet growth, margin expansion and continued execution of strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- April 25, 2024 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $78 million, or $0.52 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. These amounts compare to a loss of $94 million, or $(0.62) per common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and earnings of $100 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
"During the first quarter, we continued to make strong progress against our strategic plan," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "We added talent in key areas, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved the customer experience through product and service enhancements. Here in April, our collective efforts were recognized when we were named #1 for Retail Banking Customer Satisfaction in the Upper Midwest Region by J.D. Power.

Importantly, these efforts also contributed to the bottom line through balanced loan and deposit growth, net household growth, and expanding margins."
"As we look forward, macroeconomic question marks remain, but we feel well-positioned thanks to the stability of our markets, the resilience of our customer base, and the quarterly momentum from our initiatives. We're excited to share our progress over the remainder of the year."

The net interest margin increased to 2.79%, reflecting a 10 basis point increase from the prior quarter and a 28 basis point decrease from the same period last year.

First quarter 2024 total noninterest income of $65 million increased $196 million from the prior quarter (with the increase driven primarily by one time items impacting prior quarter results) and increased $3 million, or 5%, from the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2024 noninterest income line items:


•
Wealth management fees increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.
Service charges and deposit account fees increased $2 million from the prior quarter and decreased $1 million from the same period last year.
Capital markets, net decreased $5 million from the prior quarter and decreased $1 million from the same period last year.
Investment securities gains (losses), net increased $63 million from the prior quarter and increased $4 million from the same period last year, driven primarily by a $65 million net loss on a sale of investments associated with a balance sheet repositioning recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a $4 million gain on sale of Visa B shares recognized in the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we had no Visa B shares remaining.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the mortgage and investment securities sales announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, we continue to expect total noninterest income to decrease by 0% to 2% in 2024.
Noninterest Expense
First quarter 2024 total noninterest expense of $198 million decreased $42 million, or 17%, from the prior quarter (with the decrease driven primarily by one time items impacting prior quarter results) and increased $10 million, or 5%, from the same period last year as we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives.

Personnel expense decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.
Technology expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.
FDIC assessment expense decreased $28 million from the prior quarter and increased $7 million from the same period last year. These results were driven primarily by a $31 million special assessment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an $8 million special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the $31 million FDIC special assessment finalized during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the $8 million FDIC special assessment finalized during the first quarter of 2024, we expect total noninterest expense to grow by 2% to 3% in 2024.
Taxes
The first quarter 2024 tax expense was $20 million compared to $47 million of tax benefit in the prior quarter and $27 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 19.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.9% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.


Credit
The first quarter 2024 provision for credit losses on loans was $24 million, compared to a provision of $21 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $18 million in the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2024 credit quality:
•
Nonaccrual loans of $178 million increased $29 million from the prior quarter and increased $61 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.60% in the first quarter, up from 0.51% in the prior quarter and up from 0.40% in the same period last year.
First quarter 2024 net charge offs of $22 million increased compared to net charge offs of $16 million in the prior quarter and increased compared to net charge offs of $3 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $388 million increased $2 million compared to the prior quarter and increased $22 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.31% in the first quarter, down from 1.32% in the prior quarter and up from 1.25% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.43%
at March 31, 2024. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax.
(c)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor, and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(d)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(e)
Management believes this measure is meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of ongoing operations, and enhance comparability of results with prior periods.

Noninterest expense, excluding one time items	$	189,961		$	208,795		$	783,085	
(a)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net
.
The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, FDIC special assessment costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net and announced initiatives. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for one time costs like the FDIC special assessment and announced initiatives.
(b)
The mortgage portfolio sale and investments sold that are classified as one time items are the result of a balance sheet repositioning that the Corporation announced in fourth quarter of 2023.
