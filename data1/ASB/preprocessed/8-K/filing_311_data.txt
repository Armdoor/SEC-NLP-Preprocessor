Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2023 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $80 Million, or $0.53 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet growth and continued progress against the Company's strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 19, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $80 million, or $0.53 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

"We continued to see steady improvements in customer acquisition, retention and satisfaction scores during the quarter, enabling us to grow core customer deposits by over $500 million and decrease our reliance on non-customer funding sources," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Our strategic initiatives have also enabled us to deliver another quarter of balanced, high-quality loan growth.
While we feel well positioned today, we recognize that the banking environment continues to evolve, and we look forward to sharing more details about the second phase of our strategic plan later this quarter.”

(a)
Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net.
(b)
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax.
(c)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor, and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(d)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(e)
Management believes this measure is meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of ongoing operations, and enhance comparability of results with prior periods.
(f)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net
