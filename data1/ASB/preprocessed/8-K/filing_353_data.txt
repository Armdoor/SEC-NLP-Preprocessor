Associated Banc-Corp Reports Second Quarter 2023 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $84 Million, or $0.56 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet expansion, stable credit trends, and progress against the Company's strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- July 20, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. These amounts compare to earnings of $100 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and earnings of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.
"Our second quarter results were marked by the resilience and stability of our Midwestern markets and continued execution against our strategic plan," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Unemployment remains well below the national average in most of our footprint and economic activity has continued at a healthy pace. With these trends as a backdrop, our diversified company loan portfolio, with a prime/super prime concentration of consumer loans, has delivered strong credit performance again this quarter. This stability enabled us to add another $642 million in high-quality loans and build momentum with our customer acquisition strategies during the quarter. As a result of these efforts, we're already seeing customer checking acquisition rates 11% higher than a year ago, our attrition is down, and our digital customer satisfaction scores are at a multi-year high."
"While we're pleased with the initial results of these efforts, we've yet to realize the full impact of our customer acquisition strategies," Harmening continued. "We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering enhanced capabilities for our customers in the coming quarters. Along the way, our disciplined approach to credit, expenses and risk management will be our foundation."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

creased
$16 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter and increased
$42 million, or 19%, f
rom the same period last
year

We continue to expect the 2023 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate.
Credit
The second quarter 2023 provision for credit losses on loans was $22 million, compared to a provision of $18 million in the prior quarter and a provision of zero in the same period last year. Provision build in the second quarter was largely a function of loan growth, limited credit movement and macro trends. With respect to second quarter 2023 credit quality:


•
Nonaccrual loans of $131 million were up $14 million from the prior quarter and up $23 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.44% in the second quarter, up from 0.40% in the prior quarter and up from 0.41% in the same period last year.
Second quarter 2023 net charge offs of $11 million were up compared to net charge offs of $3 million in the prior quarter and were up compared to net charge offs of less than $1 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $377 million was up $11 million compared to the prior quarter and up $59 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.26% in the second quarter, up from 1.25% in the prior quarter and up from 1.20% in the same period last year.
In 2023, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.48%
at June 30, 2023. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

(a)
Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net.
(b)
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax.
(c)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(d)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(e)
Management believes this measure is meaningful because it reflects adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of ongoing operations, and enhance comparability of results with prior periods.
(f)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net
