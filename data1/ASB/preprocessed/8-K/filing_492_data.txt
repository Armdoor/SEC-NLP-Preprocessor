Associated Banc-Corp Reports Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings of $0.70 Per Common Share and $2.34 Per Common Share for the Full Year 2022.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- January 26, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $106 million, or $0.70 per common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. These amounts compare to earnings of $74 million, or $0.49 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and earnings of $93 million, or $0.62 per common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported earnings of $355 million, or $2.34 per common share. These amounts compare to earnings of $334 million, or $2.18 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
“This quarter served as a fitting exclamation point for the most profitable year in our company’s 162-year history,” said President and CEO Andy Harmening. “By listening to our customers and empowering our colleagues, we’ve enhanced engagement, deepened relationships, and delivered more meaningful solutions to the communities we serve. This momentum has enabled us to add nearly $4.6 billion in high-quality loan balances over the course of the year, expand margins, drive operating leverage into the double-digits, and enhance our profitability profile. Importantly, we’ve achieved all of this without abandoning our foundational discipline on expenses and credit quality."
“While we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, we feel like we’re just getting started,” Harmening continued. “As we shift to 2023, we’re closely monitoring the economic environment, but continue to feel well-positioned thanks to the diversifying benefits of our strategic plan and our decade-long effort to de-risk our balance sheet. We’ve laid the groundwork to create a stronger Associated Bank for years to come.”

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Full year 2022 net interest income of $957 million was up 32%, or $231 million, from 2021. Net interest margin of
2.91% was up 52 basis points from the prior year. The increases in net interest income and margin were driven by the execution of our strategic initiatives and rising interest rates during 2022.
•
The average yield on total earning assets increased 85 basis points from the prior year to 3.47%.
The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 45 basis points from the prior year to 0.78%.
The net free funds benefit increased 12 basis points from the prior year to 0.22%.
Fourth quarter 2022 net interest income of $289 million was up 9%, or $25 million, from the prior quarter. Net interest margin of
3.31% was up
18 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the same period last year,
net interest income increased 55%, or $102 million, and the net interest margin increased 91 basis points.
The average yield on total earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 74 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 187 basis points from the same period last year to 4.46%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 77 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 131 basis points from the same period last year to 1.58%.
The net free funds benefit for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 21 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 35 basis points from the same period last year to 0.43%.
We expect total net interest income growth of 15% to 17% in 2023.
Noninterest Income
Full year 2022 noninterest income of $282 million decreased $50 million from the prior year. The decrease was largely influenced by market-driven decreases in mortgage banking income and wealth management fees, customer-friendly changes to our overdraft program, and asset gains recognized during 2021. With respect to 2022 noninterest income line items:
Mortgage Banking, net decreased $32 million from the prior year, driven by slowing refinance activity and higher retention of mortgages on our balance sheet.
Asset gains (losses), net decreased $10 million from the prior year, driven primarily by gains on private equity investments in 2021.
Wealth management fees decreased $6 million from the prior year, driven by lower market valuations.
Service charges and deposit account fees decreased $2 million from the prior year. Guided by customer feedback, we announced several customer-friendly changes to our overdraft program in the third quarter of 2022.
Fourth quarter 2022 total noninterest income of $62 million decreased $9 million from the prior quarter and decreased $20 million from the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2022 noninterest income line items:
Investment securities gains (losses) decreased $8 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year.


•
Capital markets fees decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and decreased $4 million from the same period last year.
Mortgage Banking, net was $2 million for the fourth quarter, flat to the prior quarter and down $6 million from the same period last year, driven by slowing refinance activity and higher retention of mortgages on our balance sheet.
We expect total noninterest income to compress by 6% to 8% in 2023.
Noninterest Expense
Full year 2022 noninterest expense of $747 million increased 5%, or $37 million, from the prior year as we continued to invest in people and technology. With respect to full year 2022 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $27 million from the prior year, largely driven by higher incentive compensation and additional hiring tied to our strategic initiatives.
Technology expense increased $9 million from the prior year, driven by digital investments tied to our strategic initiatives.
Business development and advertising increased $4 million from the prior year as business activity picked up throughout the year.
Fourth quarter 2022 total noninterest expense of $197 million increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $14 million from the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2022 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense was flat to the prior quarter and increased $11 million from the same period last year.
Technology expense increased $3 million from the prior quarter and increased $5 million from the same period last year.
Occupancy expense increased $2 million from the prior quarter and decreased $1 million from the same period last year.
We expect noninterest expense to grow by 4% to 6% in 2023.
Taxes
The fourth quarter 2022 tax expense was $25 million compared to $26 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $15 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2022 was 18.9% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior quarter and an effective tax rate of 16.5% in the same period last year. The lower effective tax rate in fourth quarter 2021 was due in part to an increase in tax-exempt interest and benefits from bank and corporate owned life insurance.
In 2023, we expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.


Credit
Full year 2022 provision for credit losses was $33 million, compared to a negative provision of $88 million in the prior year. The increase in provision in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth related to our strategic initiatives.
The fourth quarter 2022 provision for credit losses was $20 million, compared to a provision of $17 million in the prior quarter and a negative provision of $6 million in the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2022 credit quality:
•
Nonaccrual loans of $111 million were down $5 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter and down $19 million, or 15%, from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.39% in the fourth quarter, down from 0.42% in the prior quarter and down from 0.54% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $1 million were down $1 million, or 37%, from the prior quarter and down $5 million, or 82%, from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $351 million was up $19 million from the prior quarter and up $32 million from the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.22% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.20% in the prior quarter and down from 1.32% in the same period last year.
In 2023, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
io
of 9.35%
at
December 31, 2022. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

Numbers may not sum due to rounding.
(a)
Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net.
(b)
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax.
(c)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(d)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(e)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(f)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches, net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and announced initiatives.
