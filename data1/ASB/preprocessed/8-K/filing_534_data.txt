Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2022 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $93 Million, or $0.62 per Common Share
Results driven by strong loan and deposit growth, expanding margins and stable credit
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 20, 2022 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $93 million, or $0.62 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. These amounts compare to earnings of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and earnings of $85 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.
“Our third quarter results were a reflection of both the strength and resilience we continue to see in our markets and our ongoing efforts to deepen relationships and deliver capabilities through our strategic initiatives,” said President and CEO Andy Harmening. “Within our footprint, unemployment remains low, the consumer remains healthy, and our commercial customers continue to seek opportunities amid an uncertain macro environment. With these trends as a backdrop, our initiatives helped bring in more than $1 billion in high-quality loans and $600 million in deposits during the quarter. This growth was supported by substantial margin expansion and stable credit trends. All of which combined to drive enhanced profitability and a return on average tangible common equity
1
north of 14%.”
“While we continue to keep a close eye on the current economic environment, we’ve been working to de-risk our balance sheet for over a decade,” Harmening continued. “Our relentless focus on credit quality and the diversifying benefits of our strategic plan put us in a position to deliver enhanced value to our stakeholders over the remainder of 2022 and beyond.”

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Third quarter 2022 net interest income of $264 million
increased
$48 million, or 22%, from the prior quarter and increased
$81 million, or 44%, f
rom the same period last
year
. The net interest margin increased to
3.13%, reflecting a
42 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and
a 75 basis point increase from the same period last year
.
•
The average yield on total loans for the third quarter of 2022 increased 90 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 114 basis points from the same period last year to 4.06%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2022 increased 45 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 51 basis points from the same period last year to 0.81%.
The net free funds benefit for the third quarter of 2022 increased 12 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 13 basis points compared to the same period last year to 0.22%.
We now expect short-term interest rates to rise by 75 basis points following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in November and expect a 50 basis point increase following the FOMC's December meeting. Based on these assumptions, we now expect our 2022 net interest income to exceed $935 million.
Noninterest Income
Third quarter 2022 total noninterest income of $71 million decreased $5 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter and decreased $11 million, or 14%, from the same period last year. With respect to third quarter 2022 noninterest income line items:
Mortgage Banking, net was $2 million for the third quarter, down $4 million from the prior quarter and down $9 million from the same period last year, driven by slowing refinance activity and higher retention of mortgages on our balance sheet.
Service charges and deposit account fees decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year.
Wealth management fees decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year.
Investment securities gains (losses) increased $6 million from the prior quarter and increased $6 million from the same period last year.
Noninterest Expense
Third quarter 2022 total noninterest expense of $196 million increased $14 million, or 8%, from the prior quarter and increased $18 million, or 10%, from the same period last year as we continued to invest in people and technology. Our third quarter noninterest expense also included an incremental $6 million expense for a contribution to our charitable foundation. With respect to other third quarter 2022 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $6 million from the prior quarter and increased $10 million from the same period last year.


•
Technology expense increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.
Occupancy expense decreased slightly from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year.
We now expect total noninterest expense of approximately $740 million to $750 million for 2022.
Taxes
The third quarter 2022 tax expense was $26 million compared to $23 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $23 million of tax expense in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate for third quarter 2022 was 21.4% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior quarter and an effective tax rate of 20.6% in the same period last year.
We continue to expect the 2022 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate.
Credit
The third quarter 2022 provision for credit losses on loans was $17 million, compared to a provision of zero in the prior quarter and a negative provision of $24 million in the same period last year. Provision build in the third quarter was largely a function of increased loan volume. With respect to third quarter 2022 credit quality:
Nonaccrual loans of $116 million were up $8 million from the prior quarter and down $19 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.42% in the third quarter, up from 0.41% in the prior quarter and down from 0.57% in the same period last year.
Third quarter net charge offs of $2 million were up compared to negligible net charge offs in the prior quarter and were down compared to net charge offs of $8 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $333 million was up $15 million compared to the prior quarter and flat compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.20% in the third quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter and down from 1.41% in the same period last year.
Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
i
o of 9.4%
at September
30
, 2022. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.
Based on current market dynamics, we now expect our TCE ratio to land within a range of 7.00% to 7.25% at year-end.

(a)
Tangible common equity and tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net.
(b)
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income available to common equity, which are used in the calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity, respectively, add back other intangible amortization, net of tax.
(c)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(d)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(e)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(f)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, asset gains, net, and gain on sale of branches, net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains, net, branch sales, and announced initiatives.
