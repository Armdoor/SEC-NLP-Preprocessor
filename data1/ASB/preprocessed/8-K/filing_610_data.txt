Associated Banc-Corp Reports First Quarter 2022 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $71 Million, or $0.47 per Common Share.
Results driven by positive margin, expense and credit trends.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- April 21, 2022 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $71 million, or $0.47 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. These amounts compare to earnings of $89 million, or $0.58 per common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and earnings of $74 million, or $0.49 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
"Our first quarter results were marked by strong positive momentum in our strategic lending initiatives," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Commercial line utilization continues to climb, employment trends in our markets continue to reflect robust productivity and credit remains remarkably benign. Our core customers continue to borrow and grow, and we remain committed to supporting them with their financial needs. In this spirit, we also announced today that we plan to implement several changes to our overdraft program in the third quarter of this year. These changes are expected to reduce the total burden of overdrafts to our customers by approximately 30%."
"As a bank, we're in a far different place than we were a year ago," Harmening continued. "We're well-positioned to deliver expanding margins, positive operating leverage and enhanced value to all of our stakeholders as we move through 2022."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
First quarter 2022 net interest income of $188 million was up 1%, or $1 million from the prior quarter and the net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the prior quarter to
2.42%
. Compared to the same period last year,
net interest income increased 7%, or $12 million, and the net interest margin increased 3 basis points.
•
The average yield on total loans for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year to 2.81%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2022 decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and decreased 14 basis points from the same period last year to 0.26%.
The net free funds benefit for the first quarter of 2022 remained flat to the prior quarter and decreased 4 basis points compared to the same period last year to 0.08%.
We now expect short-term interest rates to rise following each of this year's Federal Open Market Committee meetings. Assuming rate increases of 25 basis points or more following each meeting, we now expect our 2022 net interest income to exceed $840 million.
Noninterest Income
First quarter 2022 total noninterest income of $74 million decreased $7 million from the prior quarter and decreased $21 million from the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2022 noninterest income line items:
Mortgage Banking, net was $8 million for the first quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter. Relative to the prior-year period, Mortgage Banking was down $16 million, driven by slowing refinance activity and higher retention of mortgages on our balance sheet.
Service charges and deposit account fees decreased slightly from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.
Card-based fees decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased slightly from the same period last year.
Capital markets fees decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $1 million from the same period last year.
Guided by customer feedback, we announced today that we are making several customer-friendly changes to our overdraft program in the third quarter of 2022. The planned changes are expected to reduce service charges and deposit account fees by approximately $3 million in 2022. Additional details can be found in the press release available at investor.associatedbank.com.
Given our revised outlook for higher rates in 2022, we are also modifying our noninterest income guidance. We are now expecting less mortgage banking income and lower service charge revenues for both commercial and consumer customers over the back half of the year. We now expect total noninterest income for the year of between $290 million and $300 million.


Noninterest Expense
First quarter 2022 total noninterest expense of $173 million decreased $9 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million compared to the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2022 noninterest expense line items:
•
Personnel expense decreased $3 million from the prior quarter and increased $1 million from the same period last year.
Other expense decreased $7 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by a reduction in pension, donation and other expenses.
We expect total noninterest expense of approximately $725 million to $740 million for 2022.
Taxes
The first quarter 2022 tax expense was $19 million compared to $15 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $25 million of tax expense in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate for first quarter of 2022 was 20.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 16.5% in the prior quarter.
We expect the annual 2022 tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate.
Credit
The first quarter 2022 provision for credit losses was negative $4 million, compared to a negative provision of $6 million in the prior quarter and a negative provision of $23 million in the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2022 credit quality:
Total accruing loans 30-89 days past due of $13 million were down $3 million from the prior quarter and down $2 million from the same period last year.
Nonaccrual loans of $143 million were up $13 million from the prior quarter and down $20 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.58% in the first quarter, up from 0.54% in the prior quarter and down from 0.68% in the same period last year.
First quarter net recoveries of $2 million compared to net charge offs of $6 million in the prior quarter and net charge offs of $5 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $318 million was down $2 million from the prior quarter and down $86 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.30% in the first quarter, down from 1.32% in the prior quarter and down from 1.67% in the same period last year.
Throughout the remainder of 2022, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume.

(a)
The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength.
(b)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(c)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(d)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(e)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches, net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and announced initiatives.
