Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2021 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $85 million, or $0.56 Per Common Share.
Results driven by positive revenue growth trends.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 21, 2021 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $85 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. These amounts compare to earnings of $40 million, or $0.26 per common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and earnings of $86 million, or $0.56 per common share for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
"Our third quarter results were driven by expanding revenue trends,” remarked President and CEO Andy Harmening. "We saw increasing signs of business confidence during the quarter. Average commercial and business lending (excluding PPP) loans grew by over 3% from the second quarter. Net interest income and noninterest income also increased, and coupled with disciplined expense and capital management, we delivered a return on average tangible common equity of over 12.7%. At the end of the quarter, we successfully launched our new Auto Finance vertical and are encouraged by the early activity we are seeing. We've also rounded out the leadership team with the hiring of a new President of Equipment Finance and Leasing and are now proceeding with leaders in place for all of our strategic expansions. We look forward to updating investors about our initiatives later this quarter."

Third quarter 2021 total noninterest income of $82 million increased $9 million from the prior quarter and increased $7 million from the same period last year. With respect to third quarter 2021 noninterest income line items:
Mortgage Banking, net was $11 million for the third quarter, up $3 million from the prior quarter. Relative to the prior-year period, Mortgage Banking was down $2 million, principally due to lower gain on sale margins.

Capital markets fees increased $1 million from the prior quarter and were flat from the same period last year.
Asset gains, net increased $5 million from the prior quarter and increased $6 million from the same period last year, largely driven by private equity distributions.

Noninterest Expense
Third quarter 2021 total noninterest expense of $178 million increased $3 million from the prior quarter and decreased $50 million compared to the same period last year due to the loss on prepayment of FHLB advances in third quarter 2020.

Other expense increased $3 million from the prior quarter and decreased $4 million from the same period last year.
Legal and professional expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and $1 million from the same period last year.
We continue to expect approximately $705 million to $711 million of noninterest expense for 2021, which includes expenses from our previously announced growth and efficiency initiatives and proposed facilities exit costs.


Taxes
The third quarter 2021 tax expense was $23 million compared to $22 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $58 million of tax benefit in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate for third quarter 2021 was 20.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 19.8% in the prior quarter.
We expect the annual 2021 tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate.
Credit
The third quarter 2021 provision for credit losses was negative $24 million, compared to a negative $35 million in the prior quarter and provision of $43 million in the same period last year. With respect to third quarter 2021 credit quality:
•

Nonaccrual loans of $135 million were down $12 million, or 8%, from the prior quarter and down $97 million, or 42% from the same period last year.

Net charge offs of $8 million were up $3 million from the prior quarter and down $22 million from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $332 million was down $32 million from the prior quarter and down $110 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.41% in the third quarter, down from 1.52% in the prior quarter and down from 1.77% in the same period last year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grade, economic conditions, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume.
Capital
In the third quarter, we redeemed all outstanding Depositary Shares representing interest in our 5.375% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D at a redemption price of $25 per Depositary Share. We also repurchased $60 million of common stock during the quarter.
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
io of
10.6%
at September 30
, 2021. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches, net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and announced initiatives.
