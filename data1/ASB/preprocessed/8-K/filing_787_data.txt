Associated Banc-Corp Reports Second Quarter 2021 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $86 million, or $0.56 Per Common Share.
Results driven by improving credit dynamics, growing net interest income and continued expense discipline.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- July 22, 2021 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $86 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. These amounts compare to earnings of $145 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, or $0.94 per common share, including the net gain recognized on the sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting (“ABRC”). Excluding the gain on ABRC, second quarter 2020 earnings per share were $0.26 per common share
1
. Second quarter 2021 results also compare to earnings of $89 million, or $0.58 per common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.
"Our second quarter results were driven by continuing improvement in our loan portfolios,” remarked President and CEO Andy Harmening. “Our credit metrics continued to improve, our C&I and CRE customers began to modestly borrow on their lines, and we saw accelerating PPP pay downs - all of which are indicators of an improving economic backdrop. We also saw signs of increased business and consumer confidence; evidenced by rising spending and payments activity. We remain optimistic about the unfolding recovery in our regional footprint and are proactively pursuing various initiatives to lean into the growth we expect to see in our markets. We look forward to updating investors on these initiatives, later this quarter."
Second Quarter 2021 Highlights (all comparisons to the first quarter of 2021)
•
Period-end loans (excluding PPP) were up $216 million, to $23.5 billion
Period-end deposits were down $413 million, to $27.3 billion
Net interest income was up $4 million, to $180 million
Fee-based revenue
was up $2 million, to $53 million
Noninterest expense was down $1 million, to $174 million
Provision for credit losses was negative $35 million, compared to negative $23 million
Net income available to common equity was down $3 million, to $86 million
Earnings per common share were down $0.02, to $0.56
Tangible book value per share was up $0.40, to $17.35
This is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to
evaluate the adequacy of
earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of
ongoing operations and enhance comparability of
results with prior periods.
See page 10 of
the attached tables for
a reconciliation of
GAAP
financial measures to
non-GAAP
financial measures.


Loans
Second quarter 2021 average total loans of $24.1 billion were down 1%, or $365 million from the prior quarter and were down 4%, or $1.1 billion from the same period last year. Excluding PPP, average total loans of $23.4 billion were down 1%, or $259 million from the prior quarter and were down 4%, or $945 million from the same period last year. With respect to second quarter 2021 average balances by loan category:
•
Commercial and business lending (excluding PPP) decreased $100 million from the prior quarter and decreased $755 million compared to the same period last year to $8.4 billion.
Commercial real estate lending decreased $11 million from the prior quarter and increased $439 million from the same period last year to $6.2 billion.

Excluding PPP, period-end total loans of $23.5 billion were up 1%, or $216 million from the prior quarter and were down 1%, or $279 million from the same period last year.

Commercial real estate lending increased $39 million from the prior quarter and increased $299 million from the same period last year to $6.2 billion.

PPP loans decreased by $431 million from the prior quarter and decreased $607 million from the same period last year to $405 million.
We continue to expect full-year commercial loan growth, excluding PPP, of 2% to 4% in 2021, driven by an expected 4% to 6% increase in CRE balances and an expected 1% to 2% increase in commercial and business lending outstandings.


Deposits
Second quarter 2021 average deposits of $27.5 billion were up 2%, or $666 million compared to the prior quarter and were up 5%, or $1.3 billion from the same period last year. With respect to second quarter 2021 average balances by deposit category:
•
Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $403 million from the prior quarter and increased $1.1 billion from the same period last year to $8.1 billion.
Savings increased $311 million from the prior quarter and increased $862 million from the same period last year to $4.1 billion.

Network transaction deposits decreased $171 million from the prior quarter and decreased $636 million from the same period last year to $909 million.
Time deposits decreased $149 million from the prior quarter and decreased $960 million from the same period last year to $1.5 billion.
Second quarter 2021 period-end deposits of $27.3 billion were down 1%, or $413 million compared to the prior quarter and were up 3%, or $713 million from the same period last year. Low-cost core deposits (interest-bearing demand, noninterest-bearing demand and savings) made up 66% of deposit balances as of June 30, 2021. With respect to second quarter 2021 period-end balances by deposit category:
Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $497 million from the prior quarter and increased $425 million from the same period last year to $8.0 billion.
Savings increased $150 million from the prior quarter and increased $788 million from the same period last year to $4.2 billion.
Interest-bearing demand deposits increased $221 million from the prior quarter and increased $122 million from the same period last year to $6.0 billion.

Time deposits (excluding brokered CDs) decreased $89 million from the prior quarter and decreased $772 million from the same period last year to $1.5 billion.
Network transaction deposits (included in money market and interest-bearing deposits) decreased $183 million from the prior quarter and decreased $625 million from the same period last year to $872 million.


Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Second quarter 2021 net interest income of $180 million was up 2%, or $4 million from the prior quarter and the net interest margin decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter to
2.37%
. Compared to the same period last year,
net interest income decreased 5%, or $10 million, and the net interest margin decreased 12 basis points.
•
The average yield on total loans for the second quarter of 2021 increased 2 basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 16 basis points from the same period last year to 2.90%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the second quarter of 2021 decreased 4 basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year to 0.36%.
The net free funds benefit for the second quarter of 2021 decreased one basis point from the prior quarter and compressed 4 basis points compared to the same period last year to 0.11%.
We expect the full year margin for 2021 to be between 2.45% and 2.55%.
Noninterest Income
Second quarter 2021 total noninterest income of $73 million decreased $22 million from the prior quarter and decreased by $181 million from the same period last year, driven by the gain recognized last year on the sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting in the second quarter of 2020 and the decrease in ABRC-related income.
With respect to second quarter 2021 noninterest income line items:
Service charges and deposit account fees increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $4 million from the same period last year.
Card-based fees increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.
Mortgage Banking, net was $8 million for the second quarter, down $16 million from the prior quarter, driven by declining gain on sale margins and no additional mortgage servicing rights recoveries. Relative to the prior-year period, Mortgage Banking was down $4 million, principally due to lower gain on sale margins, offset by an $8 million MSR impairment in the prior-year period.
We expect noninterest income of between $315 million and $325 million in 2021.
Noninterest Expense
Second quarter 2021 total noninterest expense of $174 million decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and decreased $9 million compared to the same period last year.
With respect to second quarter 2021 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $3 million from the prior quarter and decreased $4 million from the same period last year.
Other expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and $4 million from the same period last year.
We are withdrawing our prior 2021 total expense guidance. Total expense for 2021 will reflect incremental growth and efficiency initiatives which are under development and expected to be announced later in the third quarter. Before the impact of such initiatives, we expect total expense for 2021 would be approximately $695 million to $700 million.


Taxes
The second quarter 2021 tax expense was $22 million compared to $25 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $51 million of tax expense in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate for second quarter 2021 was 19.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.7% in the prior quarter and an effective tax rate of 25.6% in the same period last year, which was driven by the sale of ABRC.
We expect the annual 2021 tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
Credit
The second quarter 2021 provision for credit losses was negative $35 million, compared to a negative $23 million in the prior quarter and provision of $61 million in the same period last year.
With respect to second quarter 2021 credit quality:
•
Potential problem loans of $196 million were down $68 million, or 26%, from the prior quarter and down $111 million, or 36%, from the same period last year.
Nonaccrual loans of $147 million were down $16 million, or 10%, from the prior quarter and down $24 million, or 14% from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.61% in the second quarter, down from 0.68% in the prior quarter and down from 0.69% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $5 million were down 3% from the prior quarter and down $22 million, or 83%, from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $364 million was down $40 million from the prior quarter and down $64 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.52% in the second quarter, down from 1.67% in the prior quarter and down from 1.73% in the same period last year.
We continue to experience positive credit trends due to economic conditions and expect our provision to adjust with changes to risk grade, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
io of
10.7%
at June 30
, 2021. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

(a)
The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength.
(b)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(c)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(d)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(e)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and 3Q 2020 initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, acquisition related costs, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches, net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and 3Q 2020 initiatives.
