Associated Banc-Corp Reports First Quarter 2021 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $89 million, or $0.58 Per Common Share.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- April 22, 2021 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $89 million, or $0.58 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. These amounts compare to earnings of $62 million, or $0.40 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and earnings of $42 million, or $0.27 per common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
“Driven by strong credit dynamics and the benefit of the ongoing mortgage refinance wave, we’ve delivered one of our strongest quarters ever,” said President and CEO Philip B. Flynn. “The improving credit outlook, complemented by strong fee income trends and record deposit activity drove this quarter’s earnings. The recovery has proven much stronger than we anticipated and we are optimistic about the growth we expect to come later this year. With customer activity at record levels, we are leveraging our digital capabilities and investing in our teams to meet the expanding needs of our customers across our footprint.”

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
First quarter 2021 net interest income of $176 million was down 6%, or $12 million from the prior quarter and the net interest margin decreased 10 basis points from the prior quarter to
2.39%
. Compared to the same period last year,

The net free funds benefit for the first quarter of 2021 was flat to the prior quarter and compressed 11 basis points compared to the same period last year.
We expect the full year’s margin to be approximately 2.45% to 2.55% in 2021.
Noninterest Income
First quarter 2021 total noninterest income of $95 million increased $10 million from the prior quarter and decreased by only $3 million from the same period last year, despite the loss of $23 million of Associated Benefits & Risk Consulting-related income.
With respect to first quarter 2021 noninterest income line items:
Gain on previously disclosed sale of Whitnell & Co. was $2 million.
Gains on previously disclosed sale of branches were $1 million.
Mortgage Banking, net was $24 million for the first quarter, up $9 million from the previous quarter and up $18 million from the same period last year, driven by continued refinancing volumes and mortgage servicing rights recoveries.
We expect noninterest income of $310 million to $330 million in 2021.
Noninterest Expense
First quarter 2021 total noninterest expense of $175 million increased $2 million from the prior quarter and decreased $17 million compared to the same period last year.
With respect to first quarter 2021 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $6 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased compensation, incentives and mortgage commissions, and decreased $10 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by reduced staffing as a result of corporate restructurings in third quarter 2020 and the sale of ABRC.
Other expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and $4 million from the same period last year.
We expect 2021 noninterest expense to be approximately $690 million to $695 million.


Taxes
The first quarter 2021 tax expense was $25 million compared to $17 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $10 million of tax expense in the same period last year.
The effective tax rate for first quarter 2021 was 20.7% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.1% in the prior quarter and an effective tax rate of 18.2% in the same period last year.
We expect the annual 2021 tax rate to be between 19% to 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
Credit
The first quarter 2021 provision for credit losses was negative $23 million, down from provision of $17 million in the prior quarter and provision of $53 million in the same period last year.
With respect to first quarter 2021 credit quality:
•
Potential problem loans of $264 million were down $17 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter and up $31 million, or 13%, from the same period last year.
Nonaccrual loans of $163 million were down $48 million, or 23%, from the prior quarter and up $27 million, or 19% from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.68% in the first quarter, down from 0.86% in the prior quarter and up from 0.56% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $5 million were down $23 million, or 83%, from the prior quarter and down $12 million, or 72%, from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $404 million was down $28 million from the prior quarter and up $10 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.67% in the first quarter, down from 1.76% in the prior quarter and up from 1.62% in the same period last year.
We expect our full year 2021 provision to be nominal.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
io of
10.8%
at March
31, 2021. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

(a)
The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength.
(b)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(c)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(d)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(e)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, and 3Q 2020 initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, acquisition related costs, asset gains (losses), net, and gain on sale of branches.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, asset gains (losses), net, branch sales, and 3Q 2020 initiatives.
