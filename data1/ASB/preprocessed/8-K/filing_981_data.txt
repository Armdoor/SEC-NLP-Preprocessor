Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2020 Earnings of $0.26 Per Common Share Including Restructuring Charges and Tax Benefits
GREEN BAY, Wis.
-- October 22, 2020 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $40 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Third quarter earnings, excluding restructuring charges and tax benefits, were $0.24 per common share
1
. These amounts compare to net income available to common equity of $80 million
,
or
$0.49 per common
share for the quarter ended September 30, 20
19.
Year to date earnings were $227 million, or $1.46 per common share, compared to $243 million, or $1.48 per common share, for the same period last year. Excluding restructuring charges, tax benefits from the reorganization of our securities and real estate lending subsidiaries, the gain on sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting (ABRC), and acquisition costs, year to date 2020 earnings per common share were $0.68
.
"We took action during the quarter to optimize our operations and improve efficiency," said President and CEO Philip B. Flynn. "We announced the sale or consolidation of 22 branches, along with the streamlining of our back office functions, and the restructuring of several subsidiaries and liabilities. Together we expect these actions will reduce our run-rate expenses by approximately $40 million and improve our net interest income by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. The current environment has accelerated the on-going shift of customer activity towards online and mobile banking and is driving our need to invest in technology that allows us to be more nimble, more virtual, and more digitally enabled. While the environment has been challenging, our customers are demonstrating resilience, credit trends are moderating, and the actions we have taken position us to better support our core markets going into next year.”
THIRD QUARTER 2020 SUMMARY (all comparisons to the second quarter of 2020)
•
Average loans of $25.0 billion were down 1%, or $228 million
Average deposits of $26.8 billion were up 3%, or $696 million
Net interest income of $182 million decreased, $8 million, or 4%
Provision for credit losses was $43 million, an improvement of $18 million, or 29%
Tangible book value per share was $16.37, up 1%
This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share, provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods. See pages 10 and 11 of the attached tables for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures


Loans
Third quarter 2020 average loans of $25.0 billion were down 1%, or $228 million from the second quarter 2020 and were up 7%, or $1.7 billion from the same period last year. With respect to third quarter average balances by loan category:
•
Commercial real estate lending increased $312 million from the second quarter 2020 and $875 million from the same period last year to $6.0 billion. The increase was driven by the continued funding of the existing pipeline and slowed loan payoffs.
Consumer lending was $9.2 billion, down $269 million from the second quarter 2020 and down $433 million from the same period last year. This was driven by continued refinancing activity and a $70 million mortgage portfolio sale.
Commercial and business lending decreased $271 million from the second quarter 2020 and increased $1.3 billion compared to the same period last year to $9.8 billion. General commercial line pay downs drove the decrease from last quarter and PPP loans accounted for the majority of the increase from the same period last year.
Deposits
Third quarter 2020 average deposits of $26.8 billion were up $696 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter 2020 and were up $1.6 billion, or 7%, from the same period last year.
With respect to third quarter 2020 average balances by deposit category:
Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $486 million from the second quarter and $2.1 billion from the same period last year to $7.4 billion.
Interest-bearing demand deposits increased $390 million from the second quarter and $383 million from the same period last year to $5.8 billion.
Savings increased $203 million from the second quarter and $845 million from the same period last year to $3.5 billion.
Network transaction deposits decreased $17 million from the second quarter and $237 million from the same period last year to $1.5 billion.
Money market deposits decreased $32 million from the second quarter and $468 million from the same period last year to $6.5 billion.
Time deposits decreased $334 million from the second quarter and $972 million from the same period last year to $2.1 billion.


Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Third quarter 2020 net interest income of $182 million was down 4%, or $8 million, and the net interest margin decreased 18 basis points, from the second quarter of 2020.
Third quarter 2020 net interest income decreased 12%, or $24 million, and the net interest margin decreased 50 basis points from the same period last year, to 2.31%. T
he decreases in net interest income and net interest margin from the second quarter are due to loans repricing lower after reductions to LIBOR and increasing liquidity during the third quarter.
•
The average yield on total earning assets for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 24 basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 124 basis points from the same period last year to 2.70%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 8 basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 92 basis points from the same period last year to 0.52%.
The net free funds benefit for the third quarter of 2020 decreased two basis points from the prior quarter and decreased 18 basis points compared to the same period last year.
Noninterest Income
Third quarter 2020 total noninterest income of $76 million decreased $179 million from the prior quarter and decreased $25 million from the same period last year. The second quarter included $157 million of asset gains driven by the gain on sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting ("ABRC").
With respect to third quarter 2020 noninterest income line items:
Service charges and deposit account fees were $14 million for the third quarter, up $3 million from the previous quarter and down $2 million from the same period last year.
Card-based revenue was $10 million for the third quarter, up $1 million from the previous quarter and flat from the same period last year.
Insurance commissions and fees were down $22 million from the previous quarter and down $21 million from the same period last year due to the sale of ABRC.
Noninterest Expense
Third quarter 2020 total noninterest expense of $228 million increased $44 million from the prior quarter and increased $27 million compared to the same period last year. The third quarter 2020 included $45 million of loss on prepayments of FHLB advances which were not incurred in the prior quarter or the third quarter last year.
With respect to third quarter 2020 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense decreased $3 million from the prior quarter and $15 million from the same period last year, driven by lower personnel expense from the sale of ABRC which was partially offset by severance from restructuring in 3Q 2020.
Technology expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and $1 million from the same period last year.
Occupancy expense increased $3 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year. This was driven b
y $2 million of lease termination expense.
Other expense was up $3 million from the prior quarter and $2 million from the same period last year. This was driven by $5 million of OREO expense primarily due to our restructuring.


Taxes
The third quarter 2020 tax benefit was $58 million compared to $51 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $21 million of tax expense in the same period last year.
The tax benefit recognized in the third quarter was driven by capital losses from the reorganization of our securities and real estate lending subsidiaries.
Credit
The third quarter 2020 provision for credit losses was $43 million, down from $61 million in the prior quarter and up from $2 million in the same period last year.
With respect to third quarter 2020 credit quality:
•
Potential problem loans of $293 million were down $14 million, or 5%, from the prior quarter and up $160 million, or 120%, from the same period last year.
Nonaccrual loans of $232 million were up $60 million from the prior quarter and up $103 million from the same period last year. The increase from the prior quarter was driven by three commercial real estate deals. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.93% in the third quarter, up from 0.69% in the prior quarter and up from 0.57% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $30 million were up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $9 million from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $442 million was up $13 million from the prior quarter and up $205 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.77% in the second quarter, up from 1.73% in the prior quarter and 1.04% in the same period last year.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 10.2%
at September 30, 2020. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

A corresponding after tax decrease to common equity of $98 million was recorded along with a deferred tax asset of $33 million resulting in a decrease to accrued expenses and other liabilities. Prior periods were unadjusted due to the modified retrospective application of ASU 2016-13.

(a)
The ratio tangible common equity to tangible assets excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, net. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength.
(b)
These financial measures have been included as they provide meaningful supplemental information to assess trends in the Corporation’s results of operations.
(c)
Includes trust, asset management, brokerage, and annuity fees.
(d)
Management believes these measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of earnings per common share and provide greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhanced comparability of results with prior periods.
(e)
These capital measurements are used by management, regulators, investors, and analysts to assess, monitor and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies.
(f)
The efficiency ratio as defined by the Federal Reserve guidance is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments) divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net. The fully tax-equivalent efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains / losses, net
. The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense, which excludes the provision for unfunded commitments, other intangible amortization, acquisition related costs and 3Q20 initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net, acquisition related costs, and asset gains (losses), net.
Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for acquisition related costs, provision for unfunded commitments, and asset gains (losses), net.
