Associated Banc-Corp Reports Second Quarter 2024 Earnings of $0.74 per Common Share, or $0.52 per Common Share
1
Excluding a One Time Item Recognized During the Quarter
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- July 25, 2024 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $113 million, or $0.74 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Excluding a one time tax benefit recognized during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, Associated reported earnings of $80 million, or $0.52 per common share. These amounts compare to earnings of $78 million, or $0.52 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and earnings of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.
“After demonstrating an ability to execute with Phase 1 of our strategic plan, we continued to build momentum across the company by adding talent in key areas and deploying product and digital enhancements during the second quarter,” said President and CEO Andy Harmening. “This momentum has translated to encouraging trends in several foundational performance measures, including industry-leading customer satisfaction scores and the strongest consumer checking household growth we've seen in over a decade."
“Importantly, we also delivered strong financial results during the quarter through steady revenues, credit stability and capital accretion. While macro uncertainty remains top of mind in the near-term, we feel well-positioned as we move to the back half of the year thanks to our foundational discipline, the stability of our markets, and the execution of our strategic plan.”

Network transaction deposits (included in money market and interest-bearing demand deposits) decreased $290 million from the prior quarter and decreased $98 million from the same period last year to $1.5 billion.
Based on current market conditions, we now expect 2024 core customer deposit growth to finish at the lower end of our previous 3% to 5% range on an end of period basis as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Second quarter 2024 net interest income of $257 million decreased $1 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year. The net interest margin decreased to 2.75%, reflecting a 4 basis point decrease from the prior quarter and a 5 basis point decrease from the same period last year.
The average yield on total loans for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and increased 44 basis points from the same period last year to 6.21%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the second quarter of 2024 increased 5 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 54 basis points from the same period last year to 3.60%.
The net free funds benefit for the second quarter of 2024 remained flat compared to the prior quarter and increased 2 basis points from the same period last year to 0.70%.
Based on current market conditions, we now expect total net interest income growth of 1% to 3% in 2024.
Noninterest Income
Second quarter 2024 total noninterest income of $65 million increased slightly compared to the prior quarter and decreased slightly from the same period last year. With respect to second quarter 2024 noninterest income line items:
Bank and corporate owned life insurance increased $2 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year.
Wealth management fees increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.


•
Card-based fees increased $1 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year.
Investment securities gains (losses), net decreased $4 million from the prior quarter and increased slightly from the same period last year, with the quarterly decrease driven primarily by a $4 million gain on sale of Visa B shares recognized in the first quarter of 2024.
Excluding the impact of the mortgage and investment securities sales announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, we now expect total noninterest income to finish within a range of negative 1% to 1% growth in 2024.
Noninterest Expense
Second quarter 2024 total noninterest expense of $196 million decreased $2 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter and increased $5 million, or 3%, from the same period last year as we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives. With respect to second quarter 2024 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $2 million from the prior quarter and increased $7 million from the same period last year.
Technology expense increased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.
FDIC assessment expense decreased $7 million from the prior quarter and decreased $2 million from the same period last year. The quarterly decrease was driven primarily by an $8 million increase in special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $2 million adjustment based on an updated special assessment estimate received from the FDIC in the second quarter of 2024.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the $31 million FDIC special assessment booked during the fourth quarter of 2023, the $8 million FDIC special assessment booked during the first quarter of 2024, and the $2 million FDIC special assessment adjustment booked during the second quarter of 2024, we continue to expect total noninterest expense to grow by 2% to 3% in 2024.
Taxes
Second quarter 2024 results included a tax benefit of $13 million compared to $20 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $24 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a strategic reallocation of our investment securities portfolio resulting in a deferred tax benefit of approximately $33 million during the quarter.
After excluding the impact of the one time $33 million tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21% in 2024, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.


Credit
The second quarter 2024 provision for credit losses on loans was $23 million, compared to a provision of $24 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $22 million in the same period last year. With respect to second quarter 2024 credit quality:
•
Nonaccrual loans of $154 million decreased $24 million from the prior quarter and increased $23 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.52% in the second quarter, down from 0.60% in the prior quarter and up from 0.44% in the same period last year.
Second quarter 2024 net charge offs of $21 million decreased compared to net charge offs of $22 million in the prior quarter and increased compared to net charge offs of $11 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $390 million increased $2 million compared to the prior quarter and increased $13 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.32% in the second quarter, up from 1.31% in the prior quarter and up from 1.26% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.68%
at June 30, 2024. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

.
The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, FDIC special assessment costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net and announced initiatives. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for one time costs like the FDIC special assessment and announced initiatives.
(b)
The tax benefit classified as a one time item is the result of a strategic reallocation of the Corporation's investment securities portfolio which occurred in the second quarter of 2024.
