Associated Banc-Corp Reports First Quarter 2024 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $78 Million, or $0.52 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet growth, margin expansion and continued execution of strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- April 25, 2024 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $78 million, or $0.52 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. These amounts compare to a loss of $94 million, or $(0.62) per common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and earnings of $100 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
"During the first quarter, we continued to make strong progress against our strategic plan," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "We added talent in key areas, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved the customer experience through product and service enhancements.

Importantly, these efforts also contributed to the bottom line through balanced loan and deposit growth, net household growth, and expanding margins."
"As we look forward, macroeconomic question marks remain, but we feel well-positioned thanks to the stability of our markets, the resilience of our customer base, and the quarterly momentum from our initiatives. We're excited to share our progress over the remainder of the year."

As of March 31, 2024, we had no Visa B shares remaining.

Technology expense decreased $2 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.

These results were driven primarily by a $31 million special assessment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an $8 million special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the $31 million FDIC special assessment finalized during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the $8 million FDIC special assessment finalized during the first quarter of 2024, we expect total noninterest expense to grow by 2% to 3% in 2024.
Taxes
The first quarter 2024 tax expense was $20 million compared to $47 million of tax benefit in the prior quarter and $27 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 19.8% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.9% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.


Credit
The first quarter 2024 provision for credit losses on loans was $24 million, compared to a provision of $21 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $18 million in the same period last year. With respect to first quarter 2024 credit quality:
•
Nonaccrual loans of $178 million increased $29 million from the prior quarter and increased $61 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.60% in the first quarter, up from 0.51% in the prior quarter and up from 0.40% in the same period last year.
First quarter 2024 net charge offs of $22 million increased compared to net charge offs of $16 million in the prior quarter and increased compared to net charge offs of $3 million in the same period last year.

The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.31% in the first quarter, down from 1.32% in the prior quarter and up from 1.25% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.43%
at March 31, 2024. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.
