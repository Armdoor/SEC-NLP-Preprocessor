Excluding One Time Items Recognized During the Fourth Quarter
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- January 25, 2024 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $171 million, or $1.13 per common share. These amounts compare to earnings of $355 million, or $2.34 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a loss of $94 million, or $(0.62) per common share. These amounts compare to earnings of $106 million, or $0.70 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and earnings of $80 million, or $0.53 per common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
"2023 was an extraordinary year for regional banking," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Over the course of the year, the industry was tested in several new ways amid an uncertain macro environment. We addressed the immediate risks, while our colleagues remained forward looking, taking great care of our customers while continuing to execute our people-led, digitally enabled strategy. The results of these efforts were clearly visible in the back half of the year, with diversified loan growth, improving household growth metrics, and 3% core customer deposit
growth."
"To capitalize on this momentum, we announced the next phase of our strategic plan during the fourth quarter," Harmening continued. "This plan advances our strategy by accelerating the impacts of our initiatives, and importantly, we've already made significant progress as we enter 2024. We look forward to sharing additional updates on our progress throughout the year."

Full year 2023 noninterest income of $63 million decreased $219 million from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by one time items associated with the balance sheet repositioning announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, including a $136 million loss on a mortgage portfolio sale and a $65 million net loss on a sale of investments. With respect to 2023 noninterest income line items:
Investment securities gains (losses), net decreased $63 million from the prior year, driven primarily by a $65 million net loss on a sale of investments associated with the balance sheet repositioning announced during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Fourth quarter 2023 total noninterest income of negative $131 million decreased $198 million from the prior quarter and decreased $193 million from the same period last year.

With respect to fourth quarter 2023 noninterest income line items:

Capital markets, net increased $4 million from the prior quarter and increased $4 million from the same period last year.

Technology expense increased $11 million from the prior year, driven by digital investments tied to our strategic initiatives.
Business development and advertising increased $3 million from the prior year as business activity picked up throughout the year.
Fourth quarter 2023 noninterest expense of $239 million increased $43 million from the prior quarter and increased $43 million from the same period last year, driven primarily by a $31 million expense for the FDIC special assessment finalized during the fourth quarter of 2023.

FDIC assessment expense increased $32 million from the prior quarter and $35 million from the same period last year, primarily driven by the $31 million special assessment finalized during the fourth quarter of 2023.


•
Personnel expense increased $4 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.
Technology expense increased $2 million from the prior quarter and increased $3 million from the same period last year.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the FDIC special assessment, we expect total noninterest expense to grow by 2% to 3% in 2024.
Taxes
The fourth quarter 2023 had tax benefit of $47 million compared to $19 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $25 million of tax expense in the same period last year, driven primarily by the previously announced one time items impacting financial results during the fourth quarter of 2023.
In 2024, we expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
Credit
Full year 2023 provision for credit losses was $83 million, compared to a provision of $33 million in the prior year. The increase in provision in 2023 was primarily driven by loan growth related to our strategic initiatives.
The fourth quarter 2023 provision for credit losses was $21 million, compared to a provision of $22 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $20 million in the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2023 credit quality:
Nonaccrual loans of $149 million decreased $20 million, or 12%, from the prior quarter and increased $38 million, or 34%, from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.51% in the fourth quarter, down from 0.56% in the prior quarter and up from 0.39% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $16 million decreased $3 million, or 15%, from the prior quarter and increased $15 million from the same period last year as we began to see limited credit migration during 2023.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $386 million increased $5 million from the prior quarter and increased $34 million from the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.32% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.26% in the prior quarter and up from 1.22% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.

The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.39%
at December 31, 2023. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.
