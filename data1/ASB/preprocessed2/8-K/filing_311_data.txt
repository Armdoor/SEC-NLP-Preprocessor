Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2023 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $80 Million, or $0.53 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet growth and continued progress against the Company's strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 19, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $80 million, or $0.53 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
