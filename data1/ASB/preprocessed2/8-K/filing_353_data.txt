Associated Banc-Corp Reports Second Quarter 2023 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $84 Million, or $0.56 per Common Share
Results driven by balance sheet expansion, stable credit trends, and progress against the Company's strategic initiatives
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- July 20, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. These amounts compare to earnings of $100 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and earnings of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2022.
"Our second quarter results were marked by the resilience and stability of our Midwestern markets and continued execution against our strategic plan," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Unemployment remains well below the national average in most of our footprint and economic activity has continued at a healthy pace. With these trends as a backdrop, our diversified company loan portfolio, with a prime/super prime concentration of consumer loans, has delivered strong credit performance again this quarter. This stability enabled us to add another $642 million in high-quality loans and build momentum with our customer acquisition strategies during the quarter. As a result of these efforts, we're already seeing customer checking acquisition rates 11% higher than a year ago, our attrition is down, and our digital customer satisfaction scores are at a multi-year high."
"While we're pleased with the initial results of these efforts, we've yet to realize the full impact of our customer acquisition strategies," Harmening continued. "We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering enhanced capabilities for our customers in the coming quarters. Along the way, our disciplined approach to credit, expenses and risk management will be our foundation."
