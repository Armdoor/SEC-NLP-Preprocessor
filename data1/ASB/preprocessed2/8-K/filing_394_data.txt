Associated Banc-Corp Reports First Quarter 2023 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $100 Million, or $0.66 per Common Share
Results driven by continued execution against the Company's people-led, digitally enabled plan
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- April 20, 2023 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $100 million, or $0.66 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. These amounts compare to earnings of $106 million, or $0.70 per common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and earnings of $71 million, or $0.47 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.
"Our first quarter results were fueled by the strength and stability of our core markets and our ongoing efforts to deepen relationships and deliver solutions for our customers,” said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "Here in the Midwest, unemployment remains low and economic activity remains healthy. These factors have enabled us to maintain momentum with the execution of our strategic plan. During the quarter, we once again grew both loans and deposits and drove positive operating leverage while maintaining our conservative approach to risk management. Taken together, these factors helped us deliver a return on average tangible common equity
1
above 15%."
“While several banks in other parts of the country have experienced volatility in recent weeks, our customer deposit flows were stable during the quarter,” Harmening continued. “We attribute this stability to the quality of our franchise and the resilience of the Upper Midwest markets we serve. Over our Company’s 162-year history, we’ve established deep roots in over 100 communities, and we’ve grown a granular deposit base that includes consumers, high net worth individuals, small businesses and large businesses. Our strategic plan is designed to build upon this granularity over time, and we feel well-positioned to help our customers and communities become financially stronger in 2023 and beyond.”
