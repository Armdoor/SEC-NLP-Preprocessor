Associated Banc-Corp Reports Second Quarter 2022 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $84 Million, or $0.56 per Common Share.
Results driven by robust loan growth, expanding margins, stable deposits and resilient credit.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- July 21, 2022 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $84 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. These amounts compare to earnings of $71 million, or $0.47 per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and earnings of $86 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
“Employment trends and business confidence within our core footprint markets remain strong," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "During the second quarter, we saw line utilization revert to normalized pre-pandemic levels and we supported commercial customers as they continued to grow and expand. We also continued to support consumer households in their purchases of homes and autos across our markets. The combination of commercial and consumer growth led to one of our strongest and more diversified loan growth quarters in the company's history. We complemented this growth with net deposit growth and further improving credit trends. Margins expanded, reflecting our core asset sensitivity, and we remain well-positioned to further support our customers in the quarters ahead."
“While we are pleased with the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives, we are mindful of the shifting economic environment and have continued our disciplined focus on credit quality," Harmening continued. "Our recent growth and profit expansion affords us the option to be selective in our growth strategies as we move forward."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Second quarter 2022 net interest income of $216 million increased
$37 million, or 20%, from the same period last year and increased
$28 million, or 15%, from the prior quarter. The net interest margin increased to
2.71%, reflecting a 34 basis point increase from the same period last year and a
29 basis point improvement from the prior quarter.
•
The average yield on total loans for the second quarter of 2022 increased 26 basis points from the same period last year and increased 35 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.16%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the second quarter of 2022 was flat to the same period last year and increased 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 0.36%.
The net free funds benefit for the second quarter of 2022 decreased 1 basis point compared to the same period last year and increased 2 basis points from the prior quarter to 0.10%.
We now expect short-term interest rates to rise by 75 basis points following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in July and expect a 25 basis point increase at each remaining FOMC meeting this year. Based on these assumptions, we now expect our 2022 net interest income to exceed $890 million.
Noninterest Income
Second quarter 2022 total noninterest income of $75 million increased $2 million, or 3%, from the same period last year and increased $1 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. With respect to second quarter 2022 noninterest income line items:
Mortgage Banking, net was $6 million for the second quarter, down $2 million from the same period last year and down $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by slowing refinance activity and higher retention of mortgages on our balance sheet.
Card-based fees increased slightly from the same period last year and increased $2 million from the prior quarter.
Service charges and deposit account fees increased $1 million from the same period last year and decreased slightly from the prior quarter.
Wealth management fees decreased $1 million from the same period last year and decreased $1 million from the prior quarter.
We continue to expect total noninterest income for the year of between $290 million and $300 million.

Second quarter 2022 total noninterest expense of $181 million increased $7 million, or 4%, from the same period last year and increased $8 million, or 5%, from the prior quarter. With respect to second quarter 2022 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense increased $6 million from the same period last year and increased $8 million from the prior quarter.


•
Occupancy expense decreased $1 million from the same period last year and decreased $2 million from the prior quarter.
We now expect total noninterest expense of approximately $730 million to $740 million for 2022.
Taxes
The second quarter 2022 tax expense was $23 million compared to $22 million of tax expense in the same period last year and $19 million of tax expense in the prior quarter.
The effective tax rate for second quarter of 2022 was 21.2% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.1% in the prior quarter.
We expect the 2022 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, assuming no change in the statutory corporate tax rate.
Credit
The second quarter 2022 provision for credit losses on loans was zero, compared to a negative provision of $4 million in the prior quarter and a negative provision of $35 million in the same period last year. With respect to second quarter 2022 credit quality:
Nonaccrual loans of $108 million were down $39 million from the same period last year and down $35 million from the prior quarter. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.41% in the second quarter, down from 0.61% in the same period last year and down from 0.58% in the prior quarter.
Second quarter net charge offs were negligible compared to net charge offs of $5 million in the same period last year and net recoveries of $2 million in the prior quarter.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $318 million was down $47 million compared to the same period last year and flat to the prior quarter. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.20% in the second quarter, down from 1.52% in the same period last year and down from 1.30% in the prior quarter.
Throughout the remainder of 2022, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, other indications of credit quality, and loan volume.

i
o of 9.7%
at
June 30
, 2022. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.
