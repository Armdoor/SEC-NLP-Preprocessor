Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2024 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $85 Million, or $0.56 per Common Share
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 24, 2024 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $85 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. These amounts compare to earnings of $113 million, or $0.74 per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and earnings of $80 million, or $0.53 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
“In the first nine months of 2024, we've remained squarely focused on executing Phase 2 of our strategic growth plan, and the financial tailwinds have started to emerge here in the third quarter," said President and CEO Andy Harmening. "During the quarter, we drove nearly $400 million in balanced loan growth and over $600 million in core customer deposit
1
growth, which enabled us to decrease our reliance on wholesale funding and expand our margin. We also saw strong credit performance again during the quarter, helping us to deliver solid bottom line results for our shareholders."
"We're growing our customer base, delivering industry-leading customer satisfaction, and adding top talent to our commercial banking team. We look forward to building on this momentum and providing additional updates along the way."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Third quarter 2024 net interest income of $263 million increased $6 million from the prior quarter and increased $8 million from the same period last year. The net interest margin increased to 2.78%, reflecting a 3 basis point increase from the prior quarter and a 7 basis point increase from the same period last year.
The average yield on total loans for the third quarter of 2024 increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 31 basis points from the same period last year to 6.27%.
The average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and increased 23 basis points from the same period last year to 3.59%.
The net free funds benefit for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and decreased 2 basis points from the same period last year to 0.69%.
Based on current market conditions, we now expect total net interest income growth of 0% to 1% in 2024.
Noninterest Income
Third quarter 2024 total noninterest income of $67 million increased $2 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter and increased $1 million, or 1%, from the same period last year. With respect to third quarter 2024 noninterest income line items:

•
Service charges and deposit account fees increased $1 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year.
Mortgage banking, net decreased slightly from the prior quarter and decreased $4 million from the same period last year.
Excluding the impact of the mortgage and investment securities sales announced during the fourth quarter of 2023, we continue to expect total noninterest income to finish within a range of negative 1% to 1% growth in 2024.
Noninterest Expense
Third quarter 2024 total noninterest expense of $201 million increased $5 million, or 2%, from the prior quarter and increased $4 million, or 2%, from the same period last year as we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives. With respect to third quarter 2024 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel expense decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and increased $4 million from the same period last year.
Legal and professional expense increased $1 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year.
Technology expense increased slightly from the prior quarter and increased $1 million from the same period last year.
FDIC assessment expense increased $1 million from the prior quarter and decreased $1 million from the same period last year.
After adjusting to exclude the impact of the $31 million FDIC special assessment booked during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4 million of FDIC special assessment, net recognized over the first three quarters of 2024, we now expect total noninterest expense to grow by 1% to 2% in 2024.
Taxes
Third quarter 2024 tax expense was $20 million compared to a $13 million tax benefit in the prior quarter and $19 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a strategic reallocation of our investment securities portfolio resulting in a deferred tax benefit of approximately $33 million during the quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 18.6% compared to an effective tax rate of 18.9% in the same period last year.
After excluding the impact of the one time $33 million tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2024, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be between 19% and 21% in 2024, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
Credit
The third quarter 2024 provision for credit losses on loans was $21 million, compared to a provision of $23 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $22 million in the same period last year. With respect to third quarter 2024 credit quality:


•
Nonaccrual loans of $128 million decreased $26 million from the prior quarter and decreased $40 million from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.43% in the third quarter, down from 0.52% in the prior quarter and down from 0.56% in the same period last year.
Third quarter 2024 net charge offs of $13 million decreased compared to net charge offs of $21 million in the prior quarter and decreased compared to net charge offs of $18 million in the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $398 million increased $8 million compared to the prior quarter and increased $17 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.33% in the third quarter, up from 1.32% in the prior quarter and up from 1.26% in the same period last year.
In 2024, we continue to expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.72%
at September 30, 2024. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.

The adjusted efficiency ratio is noninterest expense (which includes the provision for unfunded commitments), excluding other intangible amortization, FDIC special assessment costs, and announced initiatives, divided by the sum of fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding investment securities gains (losses), net and announced initiatives. Management believes the adjusted efficiency ratio is a meaningful measure as it enhances the comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources and provides a better measure as to how the Corporation is managing its expenses by adjusting for one time costs like the FDIC special assessment and announced initiatives.
