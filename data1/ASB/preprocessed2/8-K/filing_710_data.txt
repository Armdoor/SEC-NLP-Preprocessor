“This quarter was marked by a resurgence in lending growth as commercial outstandings, line utilization, and our new initiatives all kicked into gear,” said President and CEO Andy Harmening. “We were pleased to grow in most of our key loan and deposit verticals and took advantage of the positive economic backdrop to largely exit our remaining Oil & Gas exposure at minimal cost. We see 2022 as primed for a rebound in general commercial lending,” he continued. "Alongside the balance sheet growth, we also enjoyed growing revenues, expanding margins, and further positive credit trends."

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Full-year 2021 net interest income of $726 million was down 5%, or $37 million from 2020. Net interest margin of
2.39% was down 14 basis points from the prior year. The decreases in net interest income and margin were driven
by continued low interest rates and significant increases in liquidity during 2021.
The average yield on total earning assets decreased 39 basis points from the prior year to 2.62%.
The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 32 basis points from the prior year to 0.33%.
The net free funds benefit compressed 7 basis points from the prior year to 0.10%.

. Compared to the same period last year,
net interest income decreased 1%, or $1 million, and the net interest margin decreased 9 basis points.

The net free funds benefit for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased 1 basis point from the prior quarter and decreased 4 basis points compared to the same period last year.
We expect total net interest income to exceed $800 million in 2022.


Noninterest Income
Full-year 2021 noninterest income of $332 million decreased $182 million from the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by $9 million in investment securities gains in 2020 as well as several non-routine items in 2020, including $163 million in asset gains tied to the sale of Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting (ABRC) and a $7 million gain on branch sales. The sale of ABRC in 2020 also drove a $45 million reduction in insurance revenues year-over-year. Excluding 2020 ABRC revenues and related gains, all other noninterest income increased 9%, or $27 million year-over-year. With respect to 2021 noninterest income line items:
•
Service charges and deposit account fees increased $8 million from the prior year primarily driven by increased customer activity in 2021 and fee waivers implemented during 2020 in response to the pandemic.
Net mortgage banking income increased $5 million from the prior year, driven by a recovery of $16 million in 2021 as opposed to an impairment of $18 million in 2020, partially offset by lower gains on mortgages sold of $29 million.
Wealth management fees increased $5 million from the prior year, driven by higher market valuations.
Card-based fees increased $4 million from the prior year, driven by increased customer activity.
Fourth quarter 2021 total noninterest income of $82 million decreased $1 million from the prior quarter and decreased $4 million from the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2021 noninterest income line items:
Capital markets fees increased $3 million from the prior quarter and increased $4 million from the same period last year.
Mortgage Banking, net was $8 million for the fourth quarter, down $3 million from the prior quarter and down $6 million from the same period last year, driven by slowing refinance activity.
We expect total noninterest income to exceed $300 million in 2022.
Noninterest Expense
Full-year 2021 noninterest expense of $710 million decreased 9%, or $66 million from the prior year. Included in 2020 noninterest expense figures is the loss on prepayments of FHLB advances of $45 million. With respect to full year 2021 noninterest expense line items:
Personnel costs decreased $5 million from the prior year, largely driven by reduced headcount, partially offset by increased incentive plan expenses.
Loan and foreclosure costs decreased $4 million from the prior year, driven by
lower costs associated with resolving loans.
Business development and advertising increased $3 million from the prior year as business activity resumed in 2021.


Fourth quarter 2021 total noninterest expense of $182 million increased $4 million from the prior quarter and increased $9 million compared to the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2021 noninterest expense line items:
•
Personnel expense was flat to the prior quarter and increased $10 million from the same period last year, driven by higher incentive compensation, added costs tied to our strategic initiatives, and the implementation of a minimum wage increase.
Occupancy expense increased $1 million from both the prior quarter and the same period last year.
Other expense increased $3 million from the prior quarter and increased $2 million from the same period last year.
We expect 2022 noninterest expense to be approximately $725 million to $740 million.
Taxes
The fourth quarter 2021 tax expense was $15 million compared to $23 million of tax expense in the prior quarter and $17 million of tax expense in the same period last year. The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2021 was 16.5% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior quarter and an effective tax rate of 20.1% in the same period last year. The lower effective tax rate in fourth quarter 2021 was due in part to an increase in tax-exempt interest and benefits from bank and corporate owned life insurance compared to the prior quarter and the same period last year.
We expect the annual 2022 tax rate to be between 19% to 21%, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
Credit
Full-year 2021 provision for credit losses was negative $88 million, compared to a provision of $174 million in the prior year.
The fourth quarter 2021 provision for credit losses was negative $6 million, compared to a negative provision of $24 million in the prior quarter and provision of $17 million in the same period last year. With respect to fourth quarter 2021 credit quality:
Nonaccrual loans of $130 million were down $5 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter and down $80 million, or 38% from the same period last year. The nonaccrual loans to total loans ratio was 0.54% in the fourth quarter, down from 0.57% in the prior quarter and down from 0.86% in the same period last year.
Net charge offs of $6 million were down $1 million, or 17%, from the prior quarter and down $21 million, or 76%, from the same period last year.
The allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) of $320 million was down $12 million from the prior quarter and down $112 million compared to the same period last year. The ACLL to total loans ratio was 1.32% in the fourth quarter, down from 1.41% in the prior quarter and down from 1.76% in the same period last year.


In 2022, we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
Capital
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
io o
f 10.3%
at
December 31, 2021. The Company’s capital ratios continue to be in excess of the Basel III “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks on a fully phased in basis.
