Associated Banc-Corp Reports Third Quarter 2021 Net Income Available to Common Equity of $85 million, or $0.56 Per Common Share.
Results driven by positive revenue growth trends.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- October 21, 2021 -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE: ASB) ("Associated" or "Company") today reported net income available to common equity ("earnings") of $85 million, or $0.56 per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. These amounts compare to earnings of $40 million, or $0.26 per common share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and earnings of $86 million, or $0.56 per common share for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
"Our third quarter results were driven by expanding revenue trends,” remarked President and CEO Andy Harmening. "We saw increasing signs of business confidence during the quarter. Average commercial and business lending (excluding PPP) loans grew by over 3% from the second quarter. Net interest income and noninterest income also increased, and coupled with disciplined expense and capital management, we delivered a return on average tangible common equity of over 12.7%. At the end of the quarter, we successfully launched our new Auto Finance vertical and are encouraged by the early activity we are seeing. We've also rounded out the leadership team with the hiring of a new President of Equipment Finance and Leasing and are now proceeding with leaders in place for all of our strategic expansions. We look forward to updating investors about our initiatives later this quarter."

In the third quarter, we redeemed all outstanding Depositary Shares representing interest in our 5.375% Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D at a redemption price of $25 per Depositary Share. We also repurchased $60 million of common stock during the quarter.
The Company’s capital position remains strong, with a CET1 capital rat
