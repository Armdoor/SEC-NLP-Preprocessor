Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 30, 2024
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2024 third quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the net discrete tax benefit of $121 million in the third quarter of 2024 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, for comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 excluding the impact of the sale of the Company's noncontrolling interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Document
Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results
•
Revenue of $4.0 billion, a decrease of 2% as organic growth declined 1%
Operating margin of 26.5% as enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points
GAAP EPS of $3.91 included a divestiture gain of $1.26; ex-gain EPS of $2.65, an increase of 4%
Raising full year GAAP EPS guidance by $1.33 to a range of $11.63 to $11.73 per share
GLENVIEW, IL., October 30, 2024 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its third quarter 2024 results.
“ITW delivered solid third quarter results, as our worldwide team continued to successfully navigate and overcome market challenges with strong operational execution as evidenced by operating margin of 26.5 percent, including 130 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives, and EPS growth to $2.65 per share excluding a divesture gain,” said Christopher A. O’Herlihy, President and Chief Executive Officer. “All year, our focused execution and operational excellence have enabled the Company to effectively counter persistent market headwinds and achieve solid growth in margin and profitability while we continued to manage and invest in ITW to maximize growth and performance over the long term.”
“As we look ahead to the balance of the year and beyond, ITW remains well-positioned to continue to execute at a high level through these near-term end market macro challenges while we remain focused on driving continued progress on our long-term strategy to build above-market organic growth, fueled by customer-back innovation, into a core ITW strength,” O’Herlihy concluded.
Third Quarter 2024 Results
Third quarter revenue of $4.0 billion declined by 1.6 percent as organic growth declined by 1.4 percent. Foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.4 percent and acquisitions increased revenue by 0.2 percent.
GAAP EPS increased 53 percent to $3.91 per share and included a divestiture gain of $1.26 from the previously announced sale of the Company’s equity interest in Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). Excluding this gain, EPS of $2.65 increased four percent.
Operating income was $1.05 billion and operating margin of 26.5 percent was flat with prior year. Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and six of seven segments expanded operating margin. Sequentially, operating margin improved 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2024.
Operating cash flow was $891 million, and free cash flow was $783 million, with a conversion rate to adjusted net income of 102 percent. During the quarter, the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and raised its dividend seven percent to an annualized $6.00 per share. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.9 percent.
Wilsonart Divestiture
On August 5, 2024, the company announced the sale of its noncontrolling equity interest in Wilsonart. Proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs, were $395 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $363 million. Income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of $107 million related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards which resulted in a favorable GAAP EPS impact of $1.26. The sale is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future quarters.
2024 Guidance
ITW is incorporating the impact of the divestiture gain and a lower projected effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 21.5 percent into its 2024 guidance and raising GAAP EPS by $1.33 from the previous range of $10.30 to $10.40 to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73 per share. Based on current levels of demand and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company is maintaining its previous guidance for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for 2024. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 26.5 to 27 percent, an improvement of 165 basis points at the midpoint, with enterprise initiatives projected to contribute more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is projected to be approximately 100 percent of adjusted net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow to net income conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the


most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the potential significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding global supply chain challenges, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, the impact of enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow to net income conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, statements regarding diluted income per share, expected dividend payments, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, the impact of recent or potential acquisitions and/or divestitures, and the Company’s 2024 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include those that are detailed in ITW’s Form 10-K for 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
