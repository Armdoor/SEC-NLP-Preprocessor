Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 21, 2022, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a $3.0 billion, five-year credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent, Citibank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and a syndicate of lenders, that replaces the Company’s previous credit facility that was set to terminate on September 27, 2024. As of October 21, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under either facility.
Under the Credit Facility, the Company pays a fee on the unused amount of the commitments that varies between 0.045% and 0.09%, depending on the Company’s credit rating. Any borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars will carry, at the Company’s option, either a floating rate of interest in effect from time to time, a benchmark rate which is adjusted Term SOFR fixed for one, three or six months plus the applicable margin, or a competitive bid rate of interest. Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will carry a risk-free floating rate (if available for the applicable currency), a benchmark fixed rate (if available for the applicable currency) or a competitive bid rate of interest. The floating rate of interest is the highest of (i) the Prime Rate,
as described in the Credit Facility, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) adjusted Term SOFR for one month plus 1.00% (if one-month Term SOFR is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero). The applicable margin varies between 0.625% and 1.00%, depending on the Company’s credit rating.
The Credit Facility includes a provision under which the Company may request an increase of the total facility up to $5.0 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders’ discretion. The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens and merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the four-quarter period then ended to Total Interest Expense for the same period.
Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, foreign exchange and trust services
.
The foregoing description of the Credit Facility is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10(a) and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, all obligations of the Company under that certain five-year credit agreement dated as of September 27, 2019 among the Company, the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, were effectively terminated.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant

PAGE NUMBER: 42

the amount of the Commitment Fee, outstanding Competitive Bid Loans shall be deemed not to be a usage of the Commitments.
(b)
Certain Other Fees
. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon among the Borrowers and the Agent.
2.6.2
Reductions in Aggregate Commitment
. The Borrowers may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in a minimum aggregate amount of $25,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), ratably among the Lenders, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction,
provided
,
however
, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding Advances. All accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and on the final date upon which all Loans are repaid hereunder. The Aggregate Commitment once reduced as provided in this
Section 2.6.2
may only be reinstated as specifically provided in
Section 2.6.3
below. If (i) any Lender notifies the Company in accordance with
Section 3.5(d)
or (ii) a Borrower reasonably determines that it is or will be required to make any additional payment to any Lender under
Sections 3.1
3.2
or
3.3
, then the Company may, at any time thereafter (
that no Default or Unmatured Default then exists and no satisfactory solution has been reached pursuant to
Section 3.6
) and by not less than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent, cancel such Lender’s Commitment, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be obliged to make further Loans hereunder and its Commitment shall be reduced to zero. Upon termination of such Lender’s Commitment, each applicable Borrower shall, subject to the last sentence of this
, pay all outstanding Obligations owing to such Lender. Any notice of cancellation given pursuant to this
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date upon which such cancellation is to take effect. Notwithstanding any such cancellation, the obligations of the Company under
3.2, 3.3
and
10.6
shall survive any such cancellation and be enforceable by such Lender. In any case described in
clauses (b)(i)
(b)(ii)
above in which the Company has the right to cancel a Lender’s Commitment, the Company may, in connection with such cancellation, arrange for a sale (at par) of such Commitment and all outstanding Loans held by such Lender pursuant to the terms of
Section 13.3
and such Lender will promptly enter into any such sale arranged by the Company.
2.6.3
Increase in Aggregate Commitment
. (a) The Company may at any time propose that the Aggregate Commitment be increased (the amount of such increase being a “
Commitment Increase
”), effective as at a date prior to the Termination Date and at least 15 days after the Company proposes any such increase to the Agent in writing (an “
Increase Date
”) as to which agreement is to be reached by an earlier date specified in such notice (a “
Commitment Date
”);
, that (A) the Company may not propose more than two Commitment Increases in any calendar year, (B) the Company may not propose more than five Commitment Increases pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the minimum proposed Commitment Increase per notice shall be $10,000,000, (D) in no event shall the Aggregate Commitment hereunder at any time exceed $5,000,000,000, and (E) no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Increase Date. The Agent shall notify the Lenders thereof promptly upon its receipt of any such notice. The Agent agrees that it will cooperate with the Company in discussions with the Lenders and other lending institutions with a view to arranging the proposed Commitment Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or more of the Lenders (each such Lender that is willing to increase its Commitment hereunder being an “
Increasing Lender
”) and/or through Commitments provided by one or more Assuming Lenders;
, that it shall be in each Lender’s sole discretion whether to increase its Commitment hereunder in connection with the proposed Commitment Increase; and
further
that the
36

PAGE NUMBER: 43

minimum Commitment of each Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 2.6.3
shall be at least equal to $10,000,000. If agreement is reached on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date with any Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders as to a Commitment Increase (which may be less than but not greater than specified in the applicable notice from the Company), such agreement to be evidenced by a notice in reasonable detail from the Company to the Agent on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date, such Assuming Lenders, if any, shall become Lenders hereunder as of the applicable Increase Date and the Commitments of such Increasing Lenders and such Assuming Lenders shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the Increase Date, the amounts specified in such notice;
provided
that:
(x) the Agent shall have received (with copies for each Lender, including each such Assuming Lender) by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date a certificate of a Financial Officer, stating that the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions authorizing the Company to borrow money pursuant to this Agreement from time to time in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding in an amount at least equal to the Aggregate Commitment, after giving effect to the pending Commitment Increase, and that such resolutions remain in full force and effect and have not been modified or rescinded or attaching and certifying, if applicable, any amendments to such resolutions or supplemental borrowing resolutions (together with a similar certificate from an authorized officer of each Borrowing Subsidiary, if any are then parties to this Agreement);
(y) each such Assuming Lender shall have delivered to the Agent, by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, an appropriate Lender Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit J
hereto (a “
Lender Assumption Agreement
”), duly executed by such Assuming Lender and the Company; and
(z) each such Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent by, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, (A) its existing Ratable Note, if any, and (B) confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased Commitment.
(b) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice from the Company as to its agreement to a Commitment Increase on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date and each of the actions provided for in
clauses (i)(x)
through
(i)(z)
above shall have occurred prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date to the satisfaction of the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) and the Company of the occurrence of such Commitment Increase and shall record in its records the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and Assuming Lender. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date, make available to the Agent in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.5
(or at such other time as shall be agreed among the Agent, the applicable Lenders and the Company), in same day funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the Aggregate Commitment after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (A) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase over (B) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding before giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will, if necessary, promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective applicable Lending Installations in an amount to each other Lender such that the
37

PAGE NUMBER: 44

aggregate amount of the outstanding Ratable Advances owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase.
(c) In the event that the Agent shall not have received notice from the Company as to such agreement on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date or the Company shall, by notice to the Agent prior to the applicable Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any of the actions provided for above in
clauses (i)(x)
through
(i)(z)
shall not have occurred by 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the such Increase Date, such proposal by the Company shall be deemed not to have been made. In such event, any actions theretofore taken under
above shall be deemed to be of no effect and all the rights and obligations of the parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.
2.6.4
Extension of Termination Date
. (a) So long as no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may on up to two occasions, upon at least 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to any annual anniversary of the date hereof, by written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Lender), propose to extend the Termination Date by one year. Each Lender may, not more than 30 days nor less than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, elect by written notice to the Company and the Agent to extend its Termination Date by a period of one year. The Agent will notify the Company, in writing of the Lenders’ decisions no later than 15 days prior to such anniversary date. No Lender (or any successor thereto) shall have any obligation to extend its Termination Date, and any decision by a Lender to extend its Termination Date shall be made in its sole discretion independently from any other Lender. Any Lender that does not respond to a request to extend the Termination Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender.
(b) If any Lender shall not elect to extend its Termination Date pursuant to
paragraph (i)
above (each such Lender being a “
Non-Consenting Lender
”), the Company may designate another bank or other financial institution (which shall either be an Assuming Lender or may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Lenders) which at the time agrees to accept an assignment of the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender in accordance with
Section 13.3
;
provided
,
however
, that (A) any Assuming Lender at the time of the applicable assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent a lender assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; (B) the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $5,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; (C) any such Non-Consenting Lender shall have been paid (x) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender plus (y) any accrued but unpaid commitment fees owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (D) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and (E) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under
for such assignment shall have been paid. To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.6.4
and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with this
paragraph (ii)
, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Company, such Lender or any other Person;
that such Non-Consenting Lender’s rights under
Article III
Section 10.6
and
Article XI
(solely with respect to indemnification obligations set forth therein), shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.
38

PAGE NUMBER: 45

(c) If (after giving effect to any assignments pursuant to
paragraph (ii)
of this
Section 2.6.4
) Lenders having Commitments equal to at least 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable anniversary date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an assignment agreement pursuant to
Section 13.3
or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such anniversary date, the Agent shall so notify the Company, and so long as no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and then be continuing (and the Company shall have so certified to the Agent) on the proposed effective date of such execution, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in
paragraph (i)
, and all references in this Agreement and in the Notes to the “Termination Date” shall, with respect to each Lender other than a Non-Consenting Lender for such extension, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each extension of the Termination Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto.
Section 2.7
Minimum Amount of Each Advance

(a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (i) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Advance, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate (including because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (ii) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Agreed Currency; or
(b) the Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Advance, the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Advance for the applicable Agreed Currency and such Interest Period or (B) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Agreed Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Advance for the applicable Agreed Currency;

Section 2.6
, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, (1) any Borrowing Notice that requests the conversion of any Advance to, or continuation of any Advance as, a Term Benchmark Advance and any Borrowing Notice that requests a Term Benchmark Advance shall instead be deemed to be a Borrowing Notice, as applicable, for (x) an RFR Advance denominated in Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Advances is not also the subject of

Section 2.9.2(a)(i)

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” with respect to Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” with respect to any Agreed Currency for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

Original Currency
”) no longer exists or the Borrowers are not able to make payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. For purposes of this
Section 2.11.2
, the participation by any country in the third stage of the European Economic and Monetary Union shall not constitute the imposition of currency control or exchange regulations.
Section 2.12
Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness
.
(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made to each Borrower hereunder, the Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from each Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.
(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (a)
and
(b)
above shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
(d) Any Lender may request that its Ratable Loans or its Competitive Bid Loans be evidenced by Ratable Notes or Competitive Bid Notes, respectively. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Ratable Note or a Competitive Bid Note, as the case may be, payable to such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 13.3
) be represented by a Note payable to the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in
above.
Section 2.13
Telephonic Notices
. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances denominated in Dollars, effect selections of Types of Advances denominated in Dollars, submit Competitive Bid Quotes for Advances denominated in Dollars and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of such Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Conversion/Continuation Notices and Competitive Bid Quote Requests for Advances denominated in Dollars to be given telephonically. Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender,
44

PAGE NUMBER: 51

of each telephonic notice signed by a Financial Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 2.14
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
.
2.14.1
Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Benchmark Ratable Advance on a day other than an Interest Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Accrued interest on each RFR Loan and Term Benchmark Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date, on any date upon which such Loans are prepaid and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.
2.14.2
Interest on Loans and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year,
except
that interest on Floating Rate Loans shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year or 366 day year, as the case may be, and interest on Loans denominated in British Pounds Sterling or by reference to the CDOR Screen Rate or the AUD Screen Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year (or 366 days in a leap year). Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
Section 2.15
Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Ratable Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
Section 2.16
Lending Installations
. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with
Article XIV
, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
Section 2.17
Non Receipt of Funds by the Agent
. Unless a Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available
45

PAGE NUMBER: 52

to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the NYFRB Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
Section 2.18
Borrowing Subsidiaries
. The Company may at any time or from time to time, with the consent of the Agent and each Lender, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, add as a party to this Agreement any Subsidiary to be a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder by the execution and delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Assumption Letter by such Subsidiary, with the written consent of the Company at the foot thereof. Upon such execution, delivery and consent such Subsidiary shall for all purposes be a party hereto as a Borrowing Subsidiary as fully as if it had executed and delivered this Agreement. So long as the principal of and interest on any Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been repaid or paid in full and all other obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been fully performed, the Company may, by not less than five Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate such Borrowing Subsidiary’s status as a “Borrowing Subsidiary”.
Section 2.19
Market Disruption
. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in
Article II
and
Article IV
with respect to any Advance in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Benchmark Ratable Loans comprising such Advance to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrowers, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in
Section 2.1.1
, be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, as Floating Rate Loans, unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (a) it elects not to borrow on such date or (b) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be.
Section 2.20
Judgment Currency
. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrowers hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “
specified currency
”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Agent’s main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase
46

PAGE NUMBER: 53

the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 13.2
, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrowers.
Section 2.21
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)(i)
;
(b) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Section 8.4
or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 12.1
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder;
second
, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;
third
, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document;
fifth
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and
sixth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.3
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are funded. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; and
(c) the Commitment and principal amount of the outstanding Advances of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.2
);
provided
, that this
clause (c)
shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby.
The Agent shall provide written notice to any Lender determined by the Agent to be a Defaulting Lender hereunder (and the Agent shall provide a copy of such determination to the Company).
47

PAGE NUMBER: 54

In the event that the Agent and the Company agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, if any Loans are outstanding on such date, such Lender shall purchase, at par plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, such of the Loans of the other Lenders or a portion of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its applicable Commitment percentage.
ARTICLE III
YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
Section 3.1
Yield Protection
. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law:
(a) subjects any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b)
through
(d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or
(b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or
(c) imposes any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Fixed Rate Loans, or requires any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Fixed Rate Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Recipient,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loans) or to reduce the return received by such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Fixed Rate Loans (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loans), then, within 15 days of demand by such Recipient, the Borrowers shall pay such Recipient such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
Section 3.2
Increased Costs
.
3.2.1
If any Change in Law shall:
(a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or Adjusted TIBOR Rate, as applicable);
(b) impose on any Lender or the applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable Agreed Currency any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender; or

PAGE NUMBER: 55

(c) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, or such other Recipient of making, continuing, converting or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that as to any Lender seeking compensation under this Section 3.2.1, such Lender shall only be compensated to the extent such Lender is then generally seeking compensation from similarly situated customers under agreements related to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 3.2.1 and the definition of “Change in Law.”
3.2.2
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
3.2.3
A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
3.2.4
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 3.3
Illegality
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to a Relevant Rate, or to determine or charge interest based upon the Relevant Rate, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Agent) (an “
Illegality Notice
”), (a) any obligation of the Lenders to make Benchmark Advances, and any right of the Borrower to continue Benchmark Advances or to convert Floating Rate Loans to Benchmark Advances, shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on which Floating Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”, in each case until each affected Lender notifies the
49

PAGE NUMBER: 56

Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Company shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Benchmark Advances to Floating Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Agreed Currency and the interest rate on which Floating Rate Loans shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”), on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (if applicable), if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such Benchmark Advances to such day, or immediately, with respect to any RFR Advances or if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Benchmark Advances to such day, in each case until the Agent is advised in writing by each affected Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Relevant Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.4.
Section 3.4
Funding Indemnification
. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate Advance is not made on the date specified by the requesting Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any actual, out-of-pocket loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any actual loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Fixed Rate Advance.
Section 3.5
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
.
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers
. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.

(d) Indemnification by the Borrowers
. The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
50

PAGE NUMBER: 57

asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 13.2.4
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this
paragraph (e)
.
(f) Status of Lenders.
i. Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will enable the Company or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
i. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that each Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), an executed copy of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
52

PAGE NUMBER: 59

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

clause (D)

Section 3.5
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this
Section 3.5(g)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.

Mitigation of Additional Costs or Adverse Circumstances
. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in:

PAGE NUMBER: 60

(a) an increase in the liability of a Borrower to such Lender under
Section 3.1
,
3.2
3.3
or
3.5
; or
(b) the unavailability of a Type of Ratable Loan under
Section 2.9.2
;
then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the applicable Borrower’s obligations under any of the clauses referred to above in this
Section 3.6
, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Company and to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to its own position, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, (i) the transfer of its Loans to a Lending Installation in another jurisdiction, (ii) the assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity willing to participate in this facility or (iii) the restructure of its participation in this facility in a manner which will avoid the event in question and on terms mutually acceptable to such Lender, the Agent and the Company). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to the Company to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, or if any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, such Lender shall be obliged, at the written request of the Company, to assign all its rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.1
and
) and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity nominated by the Company with the approval of the Agent and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender;
provided
that such other bank or entity satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by
Sections 3.5(f)
13.3.3
. Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Company under
10.6
shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender.
Section 3.7
Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Benchmark Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under
3.2,
or to avoid the unavailability of Benchmark Ratable Advances under
, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
3.4
. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Benchmark Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Benchmark Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Benchmark Rate or Bid Rate, as the case may be, applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not;
, that such Lender need not disclose any information that is confidential or to the extent prohibited by law or regulation. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Article III
, no Borrower shall be required to make any payments to any Lender pursuant to
with respect to periods of time more than 90 days prior to the date upon which such Lender’s written statement in accordance with the terms of this
is first delivered to the applicable Borrower.

Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to
, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

Section 9.3
Guaranty Absolute

Section 9.5
Limitation on Obligations
.
(a) The provisions of this guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Company under this guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of the Company’s liability under this guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Company, the Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the Company’s “
Maximum Liability
”). This
with respect to the Maximum Liability of the Company is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Agent hereunder to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and neither the Company nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under this
with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law.
(b) The Company agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of the Company without impairing this guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Agent hereunder. Nothing in this
Section 9.5(b)
shall be construed to increase the Company’s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
Section 9.6
Acceleration

Section 8.1
hereof for purposes of this
, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition (whether in a bankruptcy proceeding affecting such Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise) preventing such declaration as against such Borrowing Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration or automatic acceleration, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrowing Subsidiary) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes of this
Section 9.7
Termination Date
. This guaranty shall continue in effect until the date the Aggregate Commitment shall have been terminated or otherwise expired in accordance with its terms and all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full.
Section 9.8
Foreign Currency
. The specification of payment in a specific currency at a specific place and time pursuant to this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document is essential. That currency or those currencies are also the currency of account and payment under this guaranty. If the Company is unable for any reason to effect payment of a specific currency (other than Dollars) as required by the preceding sentence or if the Company defaults in the payment when due of any payment of a specific currency (other than Dollars) under this guaranty, the Agent may, at its option, require such payment to be made to the Agent’s principal office in the equivalent amount in Dollars at the Agent’s then current selling rate for electronic transfers of that currency to the place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations were payable. In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, does not result in payment of the amount of currency due under this guaranty, upon conversion to the currency of

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor.

Section 13.3
and (c) any transfer of participating interests in the Loans must be made in compliance with
Section 13.2
. Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in compliance with this
shall be null and void, unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in accordance with
Section 13.2.1
. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (b) of this
relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or central bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee, both of which are expressly permitted;
provided
,

Participations
.
13.2.1
Permitted Participants; Effect
. Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities other than an Ineligible Institution (“
Participants
”) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
13.2.2

Section 12.1
in respect of its
83

PAGE NUMBER: 90

participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents,
provided
that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in
Section 12.1
with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in
, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with
Section 12.2
as if each Participant were a Lender. The Borrowers further agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.1
,
3.2
3.3
3.4
3.5
10.6
and
10.10
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
Section 13.3
(subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under
Section 3.5(f)
(it being understood that the documentation required under
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)),
that (a) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 3.1
or
than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrowers, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation, (b) such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Section 3.6
as if it were an assignee under
Section 13.2.2
and (c) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of
to the same extent as if it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of
with respect to any Participant.
13.2.4
Participant Register
. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “
”);
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
Assignments
.
13.3.1
Permitted Assignments
. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities other than Ineligible Institutions (“
Purchasers
”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit G
or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Company and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000;
, that (i) the foregoing consent of the Company shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof. The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans
84

PAGE NUMBER: 91

(if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the “Trade Date,” if the “Trade Date” is specified in the assignment.
13.3.2
Consents
. The consent of the Company shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund,
provided
, that (i) the consent of the Company shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof. The consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless (x) the Purchaser is a Lender or (y) solely to the extent the assignor is a Person that was a Lender on the Execution Date, the Purchaser is an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund. Any consent required under this
Section 13.3.2
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
13.3.3
Effect; Effective Date
. Upon (a) delivery to the Agent of an assignment (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating such an assignment by reference pursuant to a Platform as to which the Agent and the parties to such assignment are participants), together with any consents required by
Sections 13.3.1
and
, (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless the Purchaser is an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or such fee is waived by the Agent) and (c) the delivery by the Purchaser to the Agent of an Administrative Questionnaire, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes “plan assets” as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be “plan assets” under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
Section 13.3
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 13.2
. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 13.3.3
, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.
13.3.4
Register
. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
”). In the absence of manifest error, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
85

PAGE NUMBER: 92

notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Section 13.4
Dissemination of Information
. Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “
Transferee
”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession concerning the creditworthiness of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries;
provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by an agreement containing provisions at least as restrictive as those of
Section 10.11
of this Agreement.
Section 13.5
Tax Treatment
. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of
Section 3.5
.
