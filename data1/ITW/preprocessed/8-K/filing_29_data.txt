Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures
. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party;
provided
,
however
, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
24


expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party’s election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)
Settlements
. The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
25


SECTION 9.
Contribution
. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
26

non-defaulting
Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the
Underwriters, to purchase such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9, 17 and 18 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
SECTION 11.
Termination of this Agreement
. Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company’s securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the NYSE, or trading in securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States’ or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9, 17 and 18 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof.

*	Note: A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time.
**	Under Rule15c6-1of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the notes will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+3, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the notes should consult their own advisors.
The notes will be represented by beneficial interests in fully registered permanent global notes (the “international global notes”) without interest coupons attached, which will be registered in the name of, and shall be deposited on or about May 17, 2024 with a common depositary for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”). Any notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream will be subject to the then applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear and Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold an interest in the relevant global notes at the close of business on the date that is the clearing system business day (for these purposes, Monday to Friday inclusive except December 25th and January 1st) immediately preceding each applicable interest payment date.

The communication of this term sheet and any other document or materials relating to the issue of the notes is not being made, and such documents or materials have not been approved, by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the United Kingdom’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”). Accordingly, such documents and/or materials are not being distributed to, and must not be passed on to, the general public in the United Kingdom. This document and such other documents and/or materials are for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments and who fall within the definition of investment professionals (as defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) fall within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are other persons to whom it may otherwise lawfully be made under the Financial Promotion Order (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This document is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.

Company
”), each certify, pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.04 of the Indenture dated as of November 1, 1986, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990 (the “
Indenture
”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor Trustee, that, pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors of the Company to the undersigned and certain other officers of the Company in resolutions duly adopted on August 4, 2023, the terms and form of the Company’s (i) 3.250% Notes due 2028 (the “
2028 Notes
”) and (ii) 3.375% Notes due 2032 (the “
2032 Notes
” and, together with the 2028 Notes, the “
Notes
”) shall be as set forth below. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
1. The 2028 Notes shall be designated as “3.250% Notes due 2028.” The 2032 Notes shall be designated as “3.375% Notes due 2032.”
2. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture pursuant to this Officers’ Certificate (not including Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of other Notes pursuant to Sections 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 3.02 or 10.04 of the Indenture) initially shall be not more than €650,000,000 in the case of the 2028 Notes and €850,000,000 in the case of the 2032 Notes. The Company shall have the right from time to time, without the consent of the existing Holders of Notes of the applicable series, to create and issue additional notes of such series with the same terms and conditions as the 2028 Notes or the 2032 Notes, as applicable, except, in each case, for the issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest thereon (“Additional Notes”), provided that, with respect to such applicable series of Notes, if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the previously outstanding Notes of such series for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will have a separate ISIN and Common Code. Additional Notes of any series will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the previously outstanding Notes of such series.
3. Each Note shall bear interest from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on such Note (or any predecessor Note) has been paid or provided for, or if no interest has been paid, from and including May 17, 2024, at the rate of 3.250% per annum for the 2028 Notes and 3.375% per annum for the 2032 Notes, in each case until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.

In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF
ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.
3.250% NOTE DUE 2028
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of the Securities of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), designated as its 3.250% Notes due 2028 (individually, a “Security” and collectively, the “Securities”), issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1986 and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990 (the “Indenture”), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the “Trustee”). The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and in the Officers’ Certificate dated May 17, 2024 (the “Officers’ Certificate”) establishing certain terms of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Officers’ Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them therein. The Securities are unsecured general obligations of the Company.
The Securities are initially limited to the aggregate principal amount of Six Hundred Fifty Million Euros (€650,000,000), as specified in the Officers’ Certificate. The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the existing Holders of Securities, create and issue additional Securities with the same terms and conditions as the Securities, except for the issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest thereon, provided that if such additional Securities are not fungible with the Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional Securities will have a separate ISIN and Common Code. Additional Securities so issued will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the Securities.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments of principal and interest on the Securities by the Company will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein having power to tax) (a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the withholding of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charge is required by law or the official interpretation or administration thereof. The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Securities such additional amounts (the “additional amounts”) as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on such Securities to a Holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, will not be less than the amount provided in such Securities to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:


	1.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the Holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such Holder holds such Security), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the Holder if the Holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as:
	a.	being or having been engaged in a trade or business in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or having or having had a permanent establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction;
A-5




	b.	having a current or former connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of such Securities, the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights hereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or treated as having been a resident thereof;
	c.	being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation for United States income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;
	d.	being or having been a“10-percentshareholder” of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any successor provision, of the Company; or
	e.	being or having been a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business, as described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision;
	2.	to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of such Securities, or a portion of such Securities, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the Holder, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
	3.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the Holder, beneficial owner or any other person to (a) submit an applicable United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) FormW-8(with any required attachments) to establish the status as anon-UnitedStates person as required for purposes of the portfolio interest exemption or IRS FormW-9to establish the status as a United States person, or comply with other certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or beneficial owner of such Securities, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or (b) comply with any information gathering and reporting requirements or take any similar action (including entering into any agreement with the IRS), in each case, that is required to obtain the maximum available exemption from withholding by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that is available to payments received by or on behalf of the Holder or beneficial owner;
	4.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding or deduction by the Company or a paying agent from the payment;
	5.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld but for a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
A-6




	6.	to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
	7.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any Security, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
	8.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed or levied but for the presentation by the Holder of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
	9.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code; or
	10.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed (a) by reason of the failure of the beneficial owner to fulfill the statement requirements of Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code or any amended or successor provisions, or (b) pursuant to Section 871(h)(6) or 881(c)(6) of the Code or any amended or successor provisions; or
	11.	in the case of any combination of items (1) through (10) above.
The Securities are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Securities. Except as specifically provided hereunder, the Company will not be required to make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
Under the terms of the Indenture, the Company may consolidate or merge with another corporation or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another corporation or entity, in accordance with Article 11 thereof. Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Indenture, the successor or acquiring corporation or entity must expressly assume all of the Company’s responsibilities and liabilities under the Indenture, including the payment of all amounts due on the Securities and performance of all the covenants. For the purpose of the Securities, it shall be understood that any obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall be determined
mutatis mutandis
, by treating the jurisdiction under the laws of which such successor or acquiring corporation or entity is organized and any political subdivision or taxing authority as therein having the power to tax, as a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, relating to the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the provisions contained in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, prior to the declaration of maturity of the Securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default under the Indenture relating to the Securities and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
A-7


If, on or after the date hereof, the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company’s control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Securities or the Indenture.
This Security may be redeemed at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, on any date that is prior to March 17, 2028 at a redemption price (calculated by the Company) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed on the date of redemption or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding the redemption date.
At any time on or after March 17, 2028, the Company may also redeem some or all of the Securities, at the Company’s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the applicable Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of such Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by the Company.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by the Company, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Securities to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by the Company, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
A-8


Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice), which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the date hereof, the Company becomes or, based on a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, is likely to become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under the heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to the Securities, or (b) any act is taken by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on or after the date hereof whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in the Company being required or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, being likely to be required to pay such additional amounts, then the Company may at any time at the Company’s option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Securities on not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to Holders of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear/Clearstream) at least 10 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption. On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with the paying agent or set aside, segregate and hold in trust (if the Company is acting as paying agent), funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities to be redeemed on that redemption date. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the common depositary; provided, however, that no Securities of a principal amount of €100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Securities may not be redeemed before the Stated Maturity and shall not be entitled to any sinking, purchase or analogous fund, nor shall the Company be obligated to redeem or purchase the Securities at the option of any Holder thereof.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures which, if they pertain specifically to the Securities, may add any provisions to or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities or of any supplemental indenture relating to the Securities or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the Stated Maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the currency in which any Security is payable, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture relating to the Securities, without the consent of the Holders of all Securities then outstanding.
A-9


The Company may terminate all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture as it relates to the Securities, with certain limited exceptions described in the Indenture, by (i) irrevocably depositing in trust with the Trustee money or Federal Republic of Germany obligations (as defined below) (or a combination thereof) sufficient to pay principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities at Stated Maturity or upon the Securities’ earlier redemption, as the case may be, and (ii) complying with certain other conditions specified in the Indenture. Alternatively, the Company may, upon the making of such deposit and the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, omit to comply with its covenants in the Indenture relating to creation of secured indebtedness (Section 4.05 of the Indenture), sale and lease-back transactions (Section 4.06 of the Indenture), and transactions involving a merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation or a sale, conveyance or lease of the property of the Company substantially as an entirety to any other corporation or entity (Article Eleven), and such omission shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable as registered Securities without coupons in denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. At the office or agency to be maintained by the Company in Chicago, Illinois, United States or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Securities may be exchanged by the Holder thereof without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in respect thereof, for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of Securities of other authorized denominations.
Subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and herein, this Security is transferable and the registration of the transfer hereof may be effected by the registered Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon due presentment for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in Chicago, Illinois, United States or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, but only in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and herein, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by any person), for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a condition of and part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Indenture and this Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.

ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the “Company”), for value received, hereby promises to pay to The Bank of New York Depository (Nominees) Limited, as nominee of The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, a common depositary for Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, or its registered assigns, the principal sum of EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION EUROS (€850,000,000) subject to adjustment from time to time as reflected on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases in Global Security attached hereto on May 17, 2032 (“Stated Maturity”) at the office or agency of the Company in London, United Kingdom or such other location or locations as may be provided for pursuant to the Indenture referred to herein, in such unified coin or currency of the European Monetary Union as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest on said principal sum, in arrears, from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or if no interest has been paid, from and including May 17, 2024), to, but excluding, May 17 of each year (the “Interest Payment Date”), beginning on May 17, 2025, at the rate of 3.375% per annum, at said offices or agencies, in like coin or currency, to, but excluding, the date on which said principal sum is paid in full. The Record Date with respect to each Interest Payment Date shall be the close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on the Clearing System Business Day (as defined below) immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date (or, if this Security is held in definitive form, the 15
th
calendar day preceding each Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day). For these purposes, a “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each clearing system for which any Global Security is being held is open for business. Interest payable at Stated Maturity shall be payable to the person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or any redemption date is not a Business Day, then the related payment for such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date, Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and no further interest shall accrue as a result of such delay. The interest payable on any Interest Payment Date (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity) will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds, provided that the Company may elect that the payment of interest may be made by wire transfer or by check mailed to the registered address of the person entitled thereto as it appears on the security register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the registered owner of the Securities is a common depositary of Euroclear/Clearstream or its nominee, payments of principal and interest shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Euroclear/Clearstream.
If, on or after the date hereof, the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company’s control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking

community, then all payments will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under this Security or the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility for effecting such currency conversions.
The further provisions of this Security are continued in an attachment hereto and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF
ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.
3.375% NOTE DUE 2032
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of the Securities of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), designated as its 3.375% Notes due 2032 (individually, a “Security” and collectively, the “Securities”), issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1986 and supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 1990 (the “Indenture”), duly executed and delivered by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the “Trustee”). The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and in the Officers’ Certificate dated May 17, 2024 (the “Officers’ Certificate”) establishing certain terms of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Officers’ Certificate shall have the meanings assigned to them therein. The Securities are unsecured general obligations of the Company.
The Securities are initially limited to the aggregate principal amount of Eight Hundred Fifty Million Euros (€850,000,000), as specified in the Officers’ Certificate. The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the existing Holders of Securities, create and issue additional Securities with the same terms and conditions as the Securities, except for the issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest thereon, provided that if such additional Securities are not fungible with the Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional Securities will have a separate ISIN and Common Code. Additional Securities so issued will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the Securities.
Payment of Additional Amounts
All payments of principal and interest on the Securities by the Company will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein having power to tax) (a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the withholding of such taxes, assessments or other governmental charge is required by law or the official interpretation or administration thereof. The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Securities such additional amounts (the “additional amounts”) as are necessary in order that the net payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on such Securities to a Holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, will not be less than the amount provided in such Securities to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:


	1.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed by reason of the Holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such Holder holds such Security), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the Holder if the Holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as:
B-5




	a.	being or having been engaged in a trade or business in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or having or having had a permanent establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction;
	b.	having a current or former connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of such Securities, the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights hereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or treated as having been a resident thereof;
	c.	being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a controlled foreign corporation for United States income tax purposes or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;
	d.	being or having been a“10-percentshareholder” of the Company as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or any successor provision, of the Company; or
	e.	being or having been a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business, as described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision;
	2.	to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of such Securities, or a portion of such Securities, or that is a fiduciary, partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with respect to the Holder, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
	3.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the Holder, beneficial owner or any other person to (a) submit an applicable United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) FormW-8(with any required attachments) to establish the status as anon-UnitedStates person as required for purposes of the portfolio interest exemption or IRS FormW-9to establish the status as a United States person, or comply with other certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or beneficial owner of such Securities, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or (b) comply with any information gathering and reporting requirements or take any similar action (including entering into any agreement with the IRS), in each case, that is required to obtain the maximum available exemption from withholding by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that is available to payments received by or on behalf of the Holder or beneficial owner;
	4.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed otherwise than by withholding or deduction by the Company or a paying agent from the payment;
	5.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed or withheld but for a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
B-6




	6.	to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
	7.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on any Security, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;
	8.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed or levied but for the presentation by the Holder of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
	9.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed under sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to section 1471(b) of the Code or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code; or
	10.	to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed (a) by reason of the failure of the beneficial owner to fulfill the statement requirements of Section 871(h) or Section 881(c) of the Code or any amended or successor provisions, or (b) pursuant to Section 871(h)(6) or 881(c)(6) of the Code or any amended or successor provisions; or
	11.	in the case of any combination of items (1) through (10) above.
The Securities are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable to the Securities. Except as specifically provided hereunder, the Company will not be required to make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision.
Under the terms of the Indenture, the Company may consolidate or merge with another corporation or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another corporation or entity, in accordance with Article 11 thereof. Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Indenture, the successor or acquiring corporation or entity must expressly assume all of the Company’s responsibilities and liabilities under the Indenture, including the payment of all amounts due on the Securities and performance of all the covenants. For the purpose of the Securities, it shall be understood that any obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall be determined
mutatis mutandis
, by treating the jurisdiction under the laws of which such successor or acquiring corporation or entity is organized and any political subdivision or taxing authority as therein having the power to tax, as a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, relating to the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the provisions contained in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, prior to the declaration of maturity of the Securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities waive any past default under the Indenture relating to the Securities and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
B-7


If, on or after the date hereof, the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company’s control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros. Any such payment so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Securities or the Indenture.
This Security may be redeemed at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, on any date that is prior to February 17, 2032 at a redemption price (calculated by the Company) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed on the date of redemption or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding the redemption date.
At any time on or after February 17, 2032, the Company may also redeem some or all of the Securities, at the Company’s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the date of redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third Business Day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the applicable Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of such Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Business Day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by the Company.
“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by the Company, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Securities to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by the Company, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.
“Remaining Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
B-8


Redemption for Tax Reasons
If, (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, or any change in, or amendments to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice), which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the date hereof, the Company becomes or, based on a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, is likely to become obligated to pay additional amounts as described herein under the heading “Payment of Additional Amounts” with respect to the Securities, or (b) any act is taken by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on or after the date hereof whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in the Company being required or, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company, being likely to be required to pay such additional amounts, then the Company may at any time at the Company’s option redeem, in whole, but not in part, the Securities on not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Notice of redemption will be mailed to Holders of Securities to be redeemed by first-class mail (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear/Clearstream) at least 10 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption. On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with the paying agent or set aside, segregate and hold in trust (if the Company is acting as paying agent), funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Securities to be redeemed on that redemption date. If fewer than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular Securities or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding Securities not previously called by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the common depositary; provided, however, that no Securities of a principal amount of €100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Securities may not be redeemed before the Stated Maturity and shall not be entitled to any sinking, purchase or analogous fund, nor shall the Company be obligated to redeem or purchase the Securities at the option of any Holder thereof.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures which, if they pertain specifically to the Securities, may add any provisions to or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Securities or of any supplemental indenture relating to the Securities or modify in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the Stated Maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the currency in which any Security is payable, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture relating to the Securities, without the consent of the Holders of all Securities then outstanding.
B-9


The Company may terminate all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture as it relates to the Securities, with certain limited exceptions described in the Indenture, by (i) irrevocably depositing in trust with the Trustee money or Federal Republic of Germany obligations (as defined below) (or a combination thereof) sufficient to pay principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities at Stated Maturity or upon the Securities’ earlier redemption, as the case may be, and (ii) complying with certain other conditions specified in the Indenture. Alternatively, the Company may, upon the making of such deposit and the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Indenture, omit to comply with its covenants in the Indenture relating to creation of secured indebtedness (Section 4.05 of the Indenture), sale and lease-back transactions (Section 4.06 of the Indenture), and transactions involving a merger or consolidation of the Company into or with any other corporation or a sale, conveyance or lease of the property of the Company substantially as an entirety to any other corporation or entity (Article Eleven), and such omission shall not be an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.
The Securities are issuable as registered Securities without coupons in denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. At the office or agency to be maintained by the Company in Chicago, Illinois, United States or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, Securities may be exchanged by the Holder thereof without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in respect thereof, for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity of Securities of other authorized denominations.
Subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and herein, this Security is transferable and the registration of the transfer hereof may be effected by the registered Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon due presentment for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in Chicago, Illinois, United States or at such other location or locations as may be provided for in the Indenture, but only in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, the Officers’ Certificate and herein, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in relation thereto. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount at Stated Maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by any person), for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a condition of and part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Indenture and this Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.

We have acted as counsel to Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the offer and sale by the Company of (i) €650,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.250% notes due May 17, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and (ii) €850,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due May 17, 2032 (the “2032 Notes” and together with the 2028 Notes, the “Notes”), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated May 14, 2024 (the “Underwriting Agreement”) by and among the Company and each of Citigroup Global Markets Limited and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “Base Indenture”) dated November 1, 1986, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated May 1, 1990 (together, the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes have been offered for sale pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on May 16, 2024 to the prospectus (as amended and supplemented by the prospectus supplement, the “Prospectus”) that constitutes a part of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form
S-3
(File
No. 333-273706)
filed by the Company with the Commission on August 4, 2023 (the “Registration Statement”).
In this capacity, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Indenture, the global certificate evidencing the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s

When the Notes shall have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and issued and paid for as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the same may be limited by the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, voidable transactions, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,

ANNEX I
In rendering the accompanying opinion letter, we wish to advise you of the following additional qualifications, limitations and assumptions to which such opinion letter is subject:
(a) As to certain relevant facts, we have relied upon representations made by the Company in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”), the assumptions set forth herein, and upon certificates of, and information provided by, officers and employees of the Company, reasonably believed by us to be appropriate sources of information, as to the accuracy of such factual matters, in each case without independent verification thereof or other investigation.
(b) Our opinion letter is limited to the laws of the State of Illinois and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “Covered Laws”), and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by our opinions of any other law. Furthermore, in rendering opinions as to the Covered Laws, we have only considered the applicability of statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions that a lawyer practicing in such jurisdiction (the “Opining Jurisdictions”) exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably recognize as being directly applicable to the Company or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
(c) We express no opinion as to the enforceability or effect on the Notes to the extent they contain (i) any provision that purports to constitute or provide for the waiver and release of any rights, claims, defenses, counterclaims or remedies of the Company, including waivers by the Company of any statutory or constitutional rights or remedies; (ii) cumulative remedies to the extent such cumulative remedies purport to compensate, or would have the effect of compensating, the party entitled to the benefits thereof in an amount in excess of the actual loss suffered by such party; (iii) any remedial provisions that are not effected in a commercially reasonable manner, not taken in good faith or do not constitute fair dealing; (iv) provisions intended to permit modification thereof only by means of any agreement in writing by the parties thereto; (v) provisions that purport to establish evidentiary standards; (vi) provisions relating to the
non-waiver
of any party’s rights, including terms providing that any failure to exercise or any delay in exercising rights or remedies will not operate as a waiver of any such rights or remedies; (vii) provisions that would provide for interest in excess of the “legal rate” permitted under applicable law or are deemed to be unenforceable penalties; (viii) grants of powers of attorney; or (ix) indemnification and contribution provisions, to the extent their enforceability may be limited by federal or state securities laws or principles of public policy.
(d) We have relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons who are involved on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question and to carry out their role in the transaction; (ii) each party to each Transaction Document (other than the Company) has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such Transaction Document enforceable against it; (iii) each party to a Transaction Document (other than the Company) has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status (such as legal investment laws, foreign qualification statutes and business activity reporting requirements) as such status relates to its rights to


enforce such Transaction Document against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine (and, without limiting the foregoing, (A) each signature on any such document that is not a manual signature has been attached to or logically associated with such document by electronic symbol or process, is the act of the identified signor and has been executed or adopted by the identified signor with the present intent to adopt or accept, and to sign, such document, and (B) the parties to such document have agreed to conduct transactions by electronic means); (v) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the Covered Laws are publicly available to lawyers practicing in the Opining Jurisdictions; (vi) all relevant statutes, rules, regulations or agency actions are constitutional and valid unless a reported decision in the Opining Jurisdictions has specifically addressed but not resolved, or has established, its unconstitutionality or invalidity; (vii) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; (viii) the conduct of the parties to the Transaction Documents has complied with any requirement of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability; and (ix) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of any of the Transaction Documents.
(e) We express no opinion as to whether a court would award a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars or as to the enforceability of any provision specifying rates of exchange for, or requiring indemnity against loss in, converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.
