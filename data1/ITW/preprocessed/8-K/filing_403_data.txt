GLENVIEW, IL., January 31, 2020 -
Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results.
“The ITW team closed out 2019 with another quarter of strong execution and resilient financial performance,” said E. Scott Santi, chairman and chief executive officer. “Despite near-term macro challenges, we grew earnings per share nine percent, delivered 24.1 percent operating margin excluding higher restructuring expenses and improved after-tax return on invested capital 120 basis points to 28.9 percent.”
“For the year, in a contracting industrial demand environment including a six percent decline in global auto builds, ITW grew earnings per share five percent excluding the impact of foreign currency headwinds, higher restructuring expenses and divestiture gains. We expanded operating margin to 24.4 percent excluding higher restructuring expenses, improved after-tax return on invested capital to 28.7 percent, increased free cash flow nine percent and returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Throughout 2019, we executed very well on the things within our control and continued to make meaningful progress on our path to full-potential performance through the implementation of our ‘Finish the Job’ enterprise strategy agenda. ITW’s proprietary and powerful business model, diversified high-quality business portfolio and dedicated team of highly skilled ITW colleagues around the world position us well to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2020 and beyond,” Santi concluded.
2019 Results
Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.5 billion declined 3.1 percent with organic revenue down 1.6 percent. Foreign currency translation and divestitures reduced revenues by 1.0 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue by 60 basis points. GAAP EPS increased nine percent to $1.99 including $0.11 divestiture gains from the sale of three businesses. Operating margin was 23.7 percent. Excluding 40 basis points impact from higher restructuring expenses, operating margin improved 10 basis points to 24.1 percent. Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and price/cost was positive 30 basis points. Free cash flow was $692 million with a 114 percent conversion rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.8 percent.
Full year revenue of $14.1 billion declined 4.5 percent with organic revenue down 1.9 percent and unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 2.3 percent. PLS reduced organic revenue by 60 basis points versus 70 basis points in 2018. 2019 GAAP EPS increased two percent to $7.74 including $0.09 of net gains from divestitures. Operating margin was 24.1 percent. Excluding 30 basis points impact from higher restructuring expenses, operating margin improved 10 bps to 24.4 percent.
