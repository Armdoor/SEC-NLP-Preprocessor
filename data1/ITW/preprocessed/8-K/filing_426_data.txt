Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 27, 2019, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.., as Agent, Citibank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and a syndicate of lenders, that replaces the Company’s previous credit facility that was set to terminate on May 9, 2021. As of September 27, 2019, no amounts were outstanding under either facility.
Under the Credit Facility, the Company pays a facility fee that varies between 0.045% and 0.110%, depending on its credit rating. Any borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars will carry, at the Company’s option, either the “base rate” of interest in effect, the “eurocurrency rate,” which is a periodic fixed LIBOR plus the applicable margin, or a competitive bid rate of interest. Borrowings denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will carry the “eurocurrency rate” or a competitive bid rate of interest. The “base rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Prime Rate,
as described in the Credit Facility, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% (if one-month LIBOR is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero). The applicable margin includes a market rate spread, which is a rate per annum equal to the Company’s five-year credit default swap mid-rate spread. This spread is floored and capped between 0.25% and 1.25%, depending on the Company’s credit rating.
The Credit Facility includes a provision under which the Company may request an increase of the total facility up to $4.5 billion, with the grant of such request at the lenders’ discretion. The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to covenants restricting the Company’s ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with another entity where the Company is not the surviving entity. Further, the Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain its Interest Coverage Ratio as of the end of each quarter at not less than 3.5 to 1. This is calculated as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for the four-quarter period then ended to Total Interest Expense for the same period.
Some of the lenders named under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, foreign exchange and trust services.
The foregoing description of the Credit Facility is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facility, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, all obligations of the Company under that certain five year credit agreement dated as of May 9, 2016 among the Company, the lenders named therein and JPM, as agent, were effectively terminated.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant

Section 1.3
Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification
. The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section 2.9.2(b) of this Agreement, such Section 2.9.2(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Agent will notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.9.2, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of
Page 23

PAGE NUMBER: 30

“LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.9.2(b), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

THE CREDITS
Section 2.1
The Facility
.
2.1.1
Description of Facility
. The Lenders grant to the Borrowers a revolving credit facility pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth:
(a) each Lender severally agrees to make Ratable Loans in Agreed Currencies to each of the Borrowers in accordance with
Section 2.3

(b) each Lender may, in its sole discretion, make bids to make Competitive Bid Loans in the Agreed Currencies to each of the Borrowers in accordance with
Section 2.4
Section 2.2
Amount of Facility
. In no event may the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances (including both the Ratable Advances and the Competitive Bid Advances) to all Borrowers exceed the Aggregate Commitment. The Commitments may be terminated or reduced from time to time pursuant to
Section 2.6(b)
or
Section 8.1
, and may be increased from time to time pursuant to
Section 2.6(c)
. The Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent of:
(a) each Advance as of the date two Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date or, if applicable, date of conversion/continuation of such Advance, and
(b) all outstanding Advances on and as of the last Business Day of each quarter and on any other Business Day elected by the Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders.

and
(b)
is herein described as a “
Computation Date
” with respect to each
Page 24

PAGE NUMBER: 31

Advance for which a Dollar Equivalent is determined on or as of such day. If at any time the Dollar Equivalent of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances (calculated, with respect to those Advances denominated in Agreed Currencies other than Dollars, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Advance) exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, the Borrowers shall immediately repay Advances in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess.
2.2.2
Availability of Facility
. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the facility is available from the date hereof to the Termination Date, and the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time prior to the Termination Date.

The aggregate outstanding amount of Competitive Bid Advances shall reduce each Lender’s Commitment ratably in the proportion such Lender’s Commitment bears to the Aggregate Commitment regardless of which Lender or Lenders make such Competitive Bid Advances.
2.3.2

. Floating Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating Rate Advances are either converted into Eurocurrency Advances in accordance with this

. The Agent shall promptly notify the Company, either on behalf of the Company or on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary, of the terms (a) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Lender that is in accordance with
Section 2.4.4
and (b) of any Competitive Bid Quote that is in accordance with
and amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request. Any such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote specifically states that it is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote. The Agent’s notice to the Company shall specify the aggregate principal amount and currency of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the respective principal amounts and Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered.
2.4.6
Acceptance and Notice by Borrowers
. Not later than (i) 4:00 p.m. (London time) at least four Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, (ii) 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurocurrency Auction in Dollars or (iii) 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the Company shall notify the Agent, either on its own behalf or on behalf of a Borrowing Subsidiary, of such Borrower’s acceptance or rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
Section 2.4.5
;
provided, however,
that the failure by the Company to give such notice to the Agent shall be deemed to be a rejection of all such offers. In the case of acceptance, such notice (a “
Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice
”) shall specify the aggregate principal amount of
Page 30

PAGE NUMBER: 37

offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Company may accept or reject any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part (subject to the terms of
Section 2.4.4(b)(iv)
);
provided
that:
(a) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request,
(b) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, and
(c) the Company may not accept any offer that is described in
Section 2.4.4(c)
or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement.
2.4.7
Allocation by Agent
. If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Eurocurrency Bid Rates or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples, not greater than $1,000,000 (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers;
provided, however,
that no Lender shall be allocated a portion of any Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum amount which such Lender has indicated that it is willing to accept. Allocations by the Agent of the amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day in the case of Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances, and by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) in the case of Absolute Rate Advances, notify each Lender of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice and the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each participating Lender.
Section 2.5
Method of Borrowing
. Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Chicago to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to
Article XIV
if such Loan is denominated in Dollars. Not later than noon (local time in the city of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency in the city of and at the address of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to
if such Loan is denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars. The Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the applicable Borrower at the Agent’s aforesaid address if denominated in Dollars, and at an account of the applicable Borrower in the relevant jurisdiction and designated by the Company in the applicable Ratable Borrowing Notice or Competitive Bid Quote Request, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars.

Section 2.6
Fees; Reduction and Increase of Aggregate Commitment; Extension of Termination Date
.
(a)
Fees
(i)
Commitment Fee
. The Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereby jointly and severally agree to pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a commitment fee (the “
”) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the daily average unused amount of the Commitments, which fee shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day following the last day of March, June, September and December of each year commencing on December 31, 2019 and with a final payment due and payable on the Termination Date. For the purposes of determining the amount of the Commitment Fee, outstanding Competitive Bid Loans shall be deemed not to be a usage of the Commitments.
(ii)
Certain Other Fees
. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon among the Borrowers and the Agent.
(b)
Reductions in Aggregate Commitment
. The Borrowers may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in a minimum aggregate amount of $25,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), ratably among the Lenders, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction,
provided, however,
that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent of the outstanding Advances. All accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and on the final date upon which all Loans are repaid hereunder. The Aggregate Commitment once reduced as provided in this
Section 2.6(b)
may only be reinstated as specifically provided in
Section 2.6(c)
below. If (i) any Lender notifies the Company in accordance with
Section 3.5(d)
or (ii) a Borrower reasonably determines that it is or will be required to make any additional payment to any Lender under
Sections 3.1
or
3.2
, then the Company may, at any time thereafter (
provided
that no Default or Unmatured Default then exists and no satisfactory solution has been reached pursuant to
Section 3.6
) and by not less than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent, cancel such Lender’s Commitment, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be obliged to make further Loans hereunder and its Commitment shall be reduced to zero. Upon termination of such Lender’s Commitment, each applicable Borrower shall, subject to the last sentence of this
, pay all outstanding Obligations owing to such Lender. Any notice of cancellation given pursuant to this
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date upon which such cancellation is to take effect. Notwithstanding any such cancellation, the obligations of the Company under
,
and
10.6
shall survive any such cancellation and be enforceable by such Lender. In any case described in
clauses (b)(i)
(b)(ii)
above in which the Company has the right to cancel a Lender’s Commitment, the Company may, in connection with such cancellation, arrange for a sale (at par) of such Commitment and all outstanding Loans
Page 32

PAGE NUMBER: 39

held by such Lender pursuant to the terms of
Section 13.3
and such Lender will promptly enter into any such sale arranged by the Company.
(c)
Increase in Aggregate Commitment
. (i) The Company may at any time propose that the Aggregate Commitment be increased (the amount of such increase being a “
Commitment Increase
”), effective as at a date prior to the Termination Date and at least 15 days after the Company proposes any such increase to the Agent in writing (an “
Increase Date
”) as to which agreement is to be reached by an earlier date specified in such notice (a “
Commitment Date
”);
provided, however,
that (A) the Company may not propose more than two Commitment Increases in any calendar year, (B) the Company may not propose more than five Commitment Increases pursuant to this Agreement, (C) the minimum proposed Commitment Increase per notice shall be $10,000,000, (D) in no event shall the Aggregate Commitment hereunder at any time exceed $4,500,000,000, and (E) no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Increase Date. The Agent shall notify the Lenders thereof promptly upon its receipt of any such notice. The Agent agrees that it will cooperate with the Company in discussions with the Lenders and other lending institutions with a view to arranging the proposed Commitment Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or more of the Lenders (each such Lender that is willing to increase its Commitment hereunder being an “
Increasing Lender
”) and/or through Commitments provided by one or more Assuming Lenders;
that it shall be in each Lender’s sole discretion whether to increase its Commitment hereunder in connection with the proposed Commitment Increase; and
provided further
that the minimum Commitment of each Assuming Lender that becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 2.6(c)
shall be at least equal to $10,000,000. If agreement is reached on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date with any Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders as to a Commitment Increase (which may be less than but not greater than specified in the applicable notice from the Company), such agreement to be evidenced by a notice in reasonable detail from the Company to the Agent on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date, such Assuming Lenders, if any, shall become Lenders hereunder as of the applicable Increase Date and the Commitments of such Increasing Lenders and such Assuming Lenders shall become or be, as the case may be, as of the Increase Date, the amounts specified in such notice;
provided
that:
(x) the Agent shall have received (with copies for each Lender, including each such Assuming Lender) by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date a certificate of a Financial Officer, stating that the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted resolutions authorizing the Company to borrow money pursuant to this Agreement from time to time in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding in an amount at least equal to the Aggregate Commitment, after giving effect to the pending Commitment Increase, and that such resolutions remain in full force and effect and have not been modified or rescinded or attaching and certifying, if applicable, any amendments to such resolutions or supplemental borrowing resolutions (together with a similar certificate from an authorized officer of each Borrowing Subsidiary, if any are then parties to this Agreement);
Page 33

PAGE NUMBER: 40

(y) each such Assuming Lender shall have delivered to the Agent, by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, an appropriate Lender Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit J
hereto (a “
Lender Assumption Agreement
”), duly executed by such Assuming Lender and the Company; and
(z) each such Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Agent by, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Increase Date, (A) its existing Ratable Note, if any, and (B) confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased Commitment.
(ii) In the event that the Agent shall have received notice from the Company as to its agreement to a Commitment Increase on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date and each of the actions provided for in
clauses (i)(x)
through
(i)(z)
above shall have occurred prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date to the satisfaction of the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders (including any Assuming Lenders) and the Company of the occurrence of such Commitment Increase and shall record in its records the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and Assuming Lender. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the applicable Increase Date, make available to the Agent in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.5
(or at such other time as shall be agreed among the Agent, the applicable Lenders and the Company), in same day funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the Aggregate Commitment after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (A) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase over (B) such Increasing Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding before giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase. After the Agent’s receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will, if necessary, promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective applicable Lending Installations in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Ratable Advances owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender’s ratable portion of the Ratable Advances then outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase.
(iii) In the event that the Agent shall not have received notice from the Company as to such agreement on or prior to the applicable Commitment Date or the Company shall, by notice to the Agent prior to the applicable Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment Increase or any of the actions provided for above in
shall not have occurred by 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the such Increase Date, such proposal by the Company shall be deemed not to have been made. In such event, any actions theretofore taken under
above shall be deemed to be of no effect
Page 34

PAGE NUMBER: 41

and all the rights and obligations of the parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.
(d)
Extension of Termination Date
. (i) So long as no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may on up to two occasions, upon at least 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to any annual anniversary of the date hereof, by written notice to the Agent (who shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to each Lender), propose to extend the Termination Date by one year. Each Lender may, not more than 30 days nor less than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, elect by written notice to the Company and the Agent to extend its Termination Date by a period of one year. The Agent will notify the Company, in writing of the Lenders’ decisions no later than 15 days prior to such anniversary date. No Lender (or any successor thereto) shall have any obligation to extend its Termination Date, and any decision by a Lender to extend its Termination Date shall be made in its sole discretion independently from any other Lender. Any Lender that does not respond to a request to extend the Termination Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender.
(ii) If any Lender shall not elect to extend its Termination Date pursuant to
paragraph (i)
above (each such Lender being a “
Non-Consenting Lender
”), the Company may designate another bank or other financial institution (which shall either be an Assuming Lender or may be, but need not be, one or more of the existing Lenders) which at the time agrees to accept an assignment of the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender in accordance with
Section 13.3
;
provided
,
however
, that (A) any Assuming Lender at the time of the applicable assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent a lender assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; (B) the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $5,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; (C) any such Non-Consenting Lender shall have been paid (x) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender plus (y) any accrued but unpaid commitment fees owing to such Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment; (D) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and (E) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under
for such assignment shall have been paid. To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.6(d)
and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with this
paragraph (ii)
, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Company, such Lender or any other Person;
that such Non-Consenting Lender’s rights under
Article III
Section 10.6
and
Article XI
(solely with respect to indemnification obligations set forth therein), shall survive the Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.
Page 35

PAGE NUMBER: 42

(iii) If (after giving effect to any assignments pursuant to
paragraph (ii)
of this
Section 2.6(d)
) Lenders having Commitments equal to at least 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable anniversary date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an assignment agreement pursuant to
Section 13.3
or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such anniversary date, the Agent shall so notify the Company, and so long as no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and then be continuing (and the Company shall have so certified to the Agent) on the proposed effective date of such execution, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in
paragraph (i)
, and all references in this Agreement and in the Notes to the “Termination Date” shall, with respect to each Lender other than a Non-Consenting Lender for such extension, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each extension of the Termination Date, the Agent shall notify the Lenders of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto.
Section 2.7
Minimum Amount of Each Advance
. Each Eurocurrency Ratable Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), and each Floating Rate Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars);
provided, however,
that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment. Each Competitive Bid Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof). No Borrower shall request a Fixed Rate Advance if, after giving effect to the requested Fixed Rate Advance, more than 12 separate Fixed Rate Advances would be outstanding.
Section 2.8
Optional Principal Payments
. Each Borrower may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances, upon one Business Day’s prior notice to the Agent. Each Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4
but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof, if denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), any portion of the outstanding Eurocurrency Ratable Advances upon three Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent. A Competitive Bid Loan may not be paid prior to the last day of the applicable Interest Period.
Section 2.9
Changes in Interest Rate; Alternate Rate of Interest
.
2.9.1
Changes in Interest Rate, etc
. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.3.4
, to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance pursuant to
hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for
Page 36

PAGE NUMBER: 43

such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance. No Interest Period may end after the Termination Date.
2.9.2
Alternate Rate of Interest
. (a) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Advance:
(i) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable (including because the LIBO Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for the applicable currency and such Interest Period; or
(ii) the Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Bid Rate Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for the applicable currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Advance for the applicable currency and such Interest Period;
then the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any Conversion/Continuation Notice that requests the conversion of any Ratable Advance to, or continuation of any Ratable Advance as, a Eurocurrency Advance shall be ineffective, (B) if any Borrowing Notice requests a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance, such Advance shall be made as a Floating Rate Advance (and, in the case of any Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) and (C) any request by the Borrower for a Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advance shall be ineffective;
provided
that (x) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by the Borrowers for Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advances may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (y) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Advances, then the other Type of Advances shall be permitted.
(b) If at any time the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have not arisen but either (w) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement that the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate is insolvent (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (x) the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by it (and there is no successor administrator that will continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the
Page 37

PAGE NUMBER: 44

administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate may no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Agent and the Borrowers shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives due consideration to (a) any selection or recommendation of a replacement rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (b) any evolving or then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate);
provided
that, if such alternate rate of interest as so determined would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.2, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date a copy of such amendment is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii)(w), clause (ii)(x) or clause (ii)(y) of the first sentence of this Section 2.9.2(b), only to the extent the LIBO Screen Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), (x) any Conversion/Continuation Notice that requests the conversion of any Ratable Advance to, or continuation of any Ratable Advance as, a Eurocurrency Advance shall be ineffective, (y) if any Borrowing Notice requests a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance, such Advance shall be made as a Floating Rate Advance (and, in the case of any Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) and (z) any request by the Borrowers for a Eurocurrency Bid Rate Advance shall be ineffective.
Section 2.10
Rate After Maturity
. Except as provided in the next sentence, any Dollar‑denominated Advance not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate plus 2% per annum, payable upon demand. Any Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars that is not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, shall bear interest until paid at the rate applicable thereto plus 2% per annum, payable upon demand. In the case of a Dollar‑denominated Fixed Rate Advance the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period (or until paid if paid prior to the end of such Interest Period), at the higher of the rate otherwise applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance for such Interest Period plus 2% per annum or the Floating Rate plus 2% per annum. In the case of a Fixed Rate Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars the maturity of which is accelerated, such Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period (or until paid if paid prior to the end of such Interest Period) at the rate otherwise applicable to such Fixed Rate Advance for such Interest Period plus 2% per annum.
Page 38

PAGE NUMBER: 45

Section 2.11
Method of Payment
. (a) Each Advance shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such Advance was made or, where such currency has converted to the Euro, in the Euro. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Agent at (except as set forth in the next sentence) the Agent’s address specified pursuant to
Article XIV
, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrowers, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. All payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in any currency other than Dollars shall be made in such currency on the date due in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency for the account of the Agent, at its Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at (i) with respect to Floating Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, its address specified pursuant to
or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender and (ii) with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, in the funds received from the Borrowers at the address of the Agent’s Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
, if, after the making of any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Advance was made (the “
Original Currency
”) no longer exists or the Borrowers are not able to make payment to the Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. For purposes of this
Section 2.11(b)
, the participation by any country in the third stage of the European Economic and Monetary Union shall not constitute the imposition of currency control or exchange regulations.
Section 2.12
Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness
. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made to each Borrower hereunder, the Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from each Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.
(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (a)
and
(b)
above shall be
prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein
Page 39

PAGE NUMBER: 46

recorded;
provided, however,
that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
(d) Any Lender may request that its Ratable Loans or its Competitive Bid Loans be evidenced by Ratable Notes or Competitive Bid Notes, respectively. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Ratable Note or a Competitive Bid Note, as the case may be, payable to such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 13.3
) be represented by a Note payable to the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in
paragraphs (a)
and
(b)
above.
Section 2.13
Telephonic Notices
. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances denominated in Dollars, effect selections of Types of Advances denominated in Dollars, submit Competitive Bid Quotes for Advances denominated in Dollars and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of such Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Conversion/Continuation Notices and Competitive Bid Quote Requests for Advances denominated in Dollars to be given telephonically. Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by a Financial Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
Section 2.14
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurocurrency Ratable Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, upon the termination of the Commitments and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest on Loans and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year,
except
that interest on Floating Rate Loans shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year or 366 day year, as the case may be, and interest on Loans denominated in British Pounds Sterling or by reference to the CDOR Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365-day year (or 366 days in a leap year). Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
Page 40

PAGE NUMBER: 47

the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
Section 2.15
Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions
. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Ratable Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, Competitive Bid Borrowing Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
Section 2.16
Lending Installations
. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with
Article XIV
, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
Section 2.17
Non‑Receipt of Funds by the Agent
. Unless a Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the NYFRB Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
Section 2.18
Borrowing Subsidiaries
. The Company may at any time or from time to time, with the consent of the Agent and each Lender, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, add as a party to this Agreement any Subsidiary to be a “Borrowing Subsidiary” hereunder by the execution and delivery to the Agent of a duly completed Assumption Letter by such Subsidiary, with the written consent of the Company at the foot thereof. Upon such execution, delivery and consent such Subsidiary shall for all purposes be a party hereto as a Borrowing Subsidiary as fully as if it had executed and delivered this Agreement. So long as the principal of and interest on any Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been repaid or paid in full and all other obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Agreement shall have been fully performed, the Company may, by not less than five Business Days’ prior notice to the Agent
Page 41

PAGE NUMBER: 48

(which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate such Borrowing Subsidiary’s status as a “Borrowing Subsidiary”.
Section 2.19
Market Disruption
. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in
Article II
and
Article IV
with respect to any Advance in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would in the reasonable opinion of the Agent or the Required Lenders make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Ratable Loans comprising such Advance to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the Borrowers, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders, and such Loans shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but shall, except as otherwise set forth in
Section 2.1.1
, be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be, as Floating Rate Loans, unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least one Business Day before such date that (a) it elects not to borrow on such date or (b) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the case may be, in which the denomination of such Loans would in the opinion of the Agent and the Required Lenders be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be.
Section 2.20
Judgment Currency
. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrowers hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “
specified currency
”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Agent’s main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non‑appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 13.2
, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrowers.
Section 2.21
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Page 42

PAGE NUMBER: 49

(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.6(a)(i)
;
(b) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Section 8.4
or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 12.1
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder;
second
, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;
third
, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document;
fifth
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and
sixth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.3
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are funded. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; and
(c) the Commitment and principal amount of the outstanding Advances of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.2
);
provided
, that this
clause (c)
shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby.
The Agent shall provide written notice to any Lender determined by the Agent to be a Defaulting Lender hereunder (and the Agent shall provide a copy of such determination to the Company). In the event that the Agent and the Company agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, if any Loans are outstanding on such date, such Lender shall purchase, at par plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, such of the Loans of the other Lenders or a portion of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its applicable Commitment percentage.

ARTICLE III
YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
Section 3.1
Yield Protection
. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law:
(a) subjects any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in
clauses (b)
through
(d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto or
(b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or
(c) imposes any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Fixed Rate Loans, or requires any Recipient or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Fixed Rate Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Recipient,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining its Fixed Rate Loans (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loans) or to reduce the return received by such Recipient or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Fixed Rate Loans (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loans), then, within 15 days of demand by such Recipient, the Borrowers shall pay such Recipient such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
Section 3.2
Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations
. (a) If a Lender determines the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change in Law, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender’s policies as to capital adequacy and liquidity).
(a) If, after the date hereof, any Change in Law shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or any Floating Rate Loan as to which the
Page 44

PAGE NUMBER: 51

interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Agent and the Agent shall promptly give notice to the Company and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Company that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans or Floating Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate, and the right of the Company to convert any Loan to a Eurocurrency Loan or continue any Loan as a Eurocurrency Loan or a Floating Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be suspended and thereafter the Company may select only Floating Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate hereunder, (ii) all Floating Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a Eurocurrency Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Floating Rate Loan (and, in the case of any Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency, in the Dollar Equivalent thereof) as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period.
Section 3.3
[Reserved]
.
Section 3.4
Funding Indemnification
. If any payment of a Fixed Rate Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed Rate Advance is not made on the date specified by the requesting Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Fixed Rate Advance.
Section 3.5
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
(a)
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers
. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
Page 45

PAGE NUMBER: 52

(c)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this
Section 3.5
, such Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
(d)
Indemnification by the Borrowers
. The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 13.2.4
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this
paragraph (e)
.
(f)

(i) (A) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will enable the Company or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
Page 46

PAGE NUMBER: 53

submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that each Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), an executed copy of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) In the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement, an executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement, an executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2) an executed copy of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”) and (y) an executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax

provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D)
, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this
Section 3.5
(including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
Page 48

PAGE NUMBER: 55

refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this
paragraph (g)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this
the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)
Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
Section 3.5
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under this Agreement.
Section 3.6
Mitigation of Additional Costs or Adverse Circumstances
. If, in respect of any Lender, circumstances arise which would or would upon the giving of notice result in:
(a) an increase in the liability of a Borrower to such Lender under
Section 3.1
,
3.2
or
3.5
(b) the unavailability of a Type of Ratable Loan under
Section 2.9.2
;
then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the applicable Borrower’s obligations under any of the clauses referred to above in this
, such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware of the same notify the Agent thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Company and to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to its own position, take such reasonable steps as may be reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, (i) the transfer of its Loans to a Lending Installation in another jurisdiction, (ii) the assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity willing to participate in this facility or (iii) the restructure of its participation in this facility in a manner which will avoid the event in question and on terms mutually acceptable to such Lender, the Agent and the Company). If and so long as a Lender has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps acceptable to the Company to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, or if any Lender has become a Defaulting Lender, such Lender shall be obliged, at the written request of the Company, to assign all its rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.1
and
) and obligations hereunder to another bank or other entity nominated by the Company with the approval of the Agent and willing to participate in the facility in place of such Lender;
provided
that such other bank or entity satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement including, but not limited to, providing the forms required by
Sections 3.5(f)
13.3.3
. Notwithstanding any such assignment, the obligations of the Company under
10.6
shall survive any such assignment and be enforceable by such Lender.

Section 3.7
Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under
Sections 3.1
,
3.2
and
3.5
or to avoid the unavailability of Eurocurrency Ratable Advances under
Section 2.9.2
, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
Section 3.1
3.4
or
. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurocurrency Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurocurrency Rate or Eurocurrency Bid Rate, as the case may be, applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not;
provided
, that such Lender need not disclose any information that is confidential or to the extent prohibited by law or regulation. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Article III
, no Borrower shall be required to make any payments to any Lender pursuant to
with respect to periods of time more than 90 days prior to the date upon which such Lender’s written statement in accordance with the terms of this
is first delivered to the applicable Borrower.

Section 13.3.3
without obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement.

Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to
Section 8.2
, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

”).

The Agent and the Lenders shall have no obligation to disclose or discuss with the Company their assessments of the financial condition of the Borrowing Subsidiaries.
Section 9.3
Guaranty Absolute
. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a primary obligation of the Company and not one of surety, and the validity and enforceability of this guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any collateral, any other guaranties with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or any other obligation of any Person with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of obligations other than the Guaranteed Obligations, any part thereof or

clauses (a)
through
(k)
of this paragraph. It is agreed that the Company’s liability hereunder is several and independent of any other guaranties or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof and that the Company’s liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or non‑enforcement of any such other guaranties or other obligations or any provision of any applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Borrowing Subsidiary of the Guaranteed Obligations in the manner agreed upon between the Borrowing Subsidiary and the Agent and the Lenders.
Section 9.4

Section 9.5
Limitation on Obligations
.
(a) The provisions of this guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Company under this guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of the Company’s liability under this guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Company, the Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the Company’s “
Maximum Liability
”). This
with respect to the Maximum Liability of the Company is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Agent hereunder to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance
Page 66

PAGE NUMBER: 73

under applicable law, and neither the Company nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under this
Section 9.5
with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law.
(b) The Company agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of the Company without impairing this guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Agent hereunder. Nothing in this
Section 9.5(b)
shall be construed to increase the Company’s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
Section 9.6
Acceleration
. The Company agrees that, as between the Company on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Agent, on the other hand, the obligations of each Borrowing Subsidiary guaranteed under this
Article IX

Section 8.1
hereof for purposes of this
, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition (whether in a bankruptcy proceeding affecting such Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise) preventing such declaration as against such Borrowing Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration or automatic acceleration, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Borrowing Subsidiary) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes of this
.
Section 9.7
Termination Date
. This guaranty shall continue in effect until the date the Aggregate Commitment shall have been terminated or otherwise expired in accordance with its terms and all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full.
Section 9.8
Foreign Currency
. The specification of payment in a specific currency at a specific place and time pursuant to this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document is essential. That currency or those currencies are also the currency of account and payment under this guaranty. If the Company is unable for any reason to effect payment of a specific currency (other than Dollars) as required by the preceding sentence or if the Company defaults in the payment when due of any payment of a specific currency (other than Dollars) under this guaranty, the Agent may, at its option, require such payment to be made to the Agent’s principal office in the equivalent amount in Dollars at the Agent’s then current selling rate for electronic transfers of that currency to the place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations were payable. In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, does not result in payment of the amount of currency due under this guaranty, upon conversion to the currency of account and transfer to the place specified for payment, the Agent and the Lenders shall have an independent cause of action against the Company for the deficiency.

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

The bank serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Agent hereunder.

or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 8.2
) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Unmatured Default or Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV
or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.
The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article XI
and
Article X
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute between
Page 75

PAGE NUMBER: 82

the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents,
provided
that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to
Section 3.5(g)
shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.6
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and not investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrowers and their Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Lenders designated as the Syndication Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities and such Lenders shall not have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any other Lender, and no implied responsibilities, duties or obligations shall be construed to exist in this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(b) Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Agent from time to time (including, as of the Execution Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders, and each of the Borrowers acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders and each of the Borrowers hereby approves distribution of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
(c) THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”.

Participants

In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

provided
that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in
with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in
, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with

Section 3.5(f)
(it being understood that the documentation required under
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)),
that (a) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 3.1

provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

Purchasers
”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit G
or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Company and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000;
, that (i) the foregoing consent of the Company shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof.

Page 82

PAGE NUMBER: 89

having received notice thereof.

13.3.2
, (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless the Purchaser is an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or such fee is waived by the Agent) and (c) the delivery by the Purchaser to the Agent of an Administrative Questionnaire, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes “plan assets” as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be “plan assets” under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
Section 13.3
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 13.2
. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 13.3.3
, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.
13.3.4
Register

The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
”). In the absence of manifest error, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
Page 83

provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by an agreement containing provisions at least as restrictive as those of
Section 10.11
of this Agreement.
