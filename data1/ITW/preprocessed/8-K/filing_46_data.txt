Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
April 30, 2024
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2024 first quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the cumulative effect of a change in inventory accounting method from net income in the first quarter of 2024. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 excluding the cumulative effect of a change in inventory accounting method. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Document
Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports First Quarter 2024 Results
•
Revenue of $4.0 billion, organic growth declined (0.6)% as expected
Operating income of $1.13 billion, an increase of 16% includes $117 million benefit from a one-time LIFO accounting change (“item”); ex-item, operating income was $1.01 billion, an increase of 4%
Operating margin of 28.4%, an increase of 420 bps; 25.4% ex-item, an increase of 120 bps as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 bps
GAAP EPS of $2.73, an increase of 17%; EPS of $2.44 ex-item, an increase of 5%
Reaffirming full-year organic growth guidance of 1 to 3% and raising full-year GAAP EPS guidance by $0.30 to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share
GLENVIEW, IL., April 30, 2024 - Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first quarter 2024 results and raised guidance for full-year 2024.
“While the near-term demand environment across the majority of our segments was challenging as expected, the ITW team delivered a solid start to the year as operating income grew four percent, operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 25.4 percent, and EPS increased five percent to $2.44, excluding a one-time item,” said Christopher A. O’Herlihy, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead, we expect current levels of demand across our end markets and favorable year-over-year comparisons will translate to positive organic growth through the balance of the year. Combined with our strong margin and profitability performance, I am confident that ITW is on track and well positioned to deliver on our 2024 performance targets including positive organic growth of one to three percent.”
First Quarter 2024 Results
First quarter revenue of $4.0 billion declined by one percent as organic growth declined by 0.6 percent. Foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.4 percent.
GAAP EPS increased 17 percent to $2.73 and included $0.29 of favorable impact from a one-time LIFO inventory accounting change. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.44 increased five percent. Operating income increased 16 percent to $1.13 billion and included $117 million of pre-tax impact from the one-time item. Excluding the one-time item, operating income grew four percent. Operating margin improved 420 basis points to 28.4 percent. Excluding the one-time item, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.4 percent as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Operating cash flow was $589 million, and free cash flow was $494 million with a conversion of 68 percent to net income excluding the one-time item. During the quarter, the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and the effective tax rate was 23.6 percent.
One-Time LIFO Inventory Accounting Change
As of December 31, 2023, the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method was used to determine the cost of inventories at certain U.S. businesses representing approximately 23 percent of total inventories. During the first quarter of 2024, ITW changed the method used to determine the cost of inventory at these businesses from LIFO to the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method to provide a more consistent and simpler method for valuing inventory across its operations. The company recorded the pre-tax cumulative effect of this change in accounting method of $117 million resulting in an increase to inventories and a reduction in cost of revenue in the quarter.
2024 Guidance
ITW is incorporating the impact of the one-time item into its full-year 2024 guidance and raising GAAP EPS by $0.30 to a range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share and operating margin by 50 basis points to a range of 26 to 27 percent with enterprise initiatives expected to contribute more than 100 basis points. The company projects revenue growth of two to four percent and organic growth of one to three percent based on current levels of demand and foreign exchange rates. Free cash flow is expected to exceed 100 percent of net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares. The projected effective tax rate is in the range of 24 to 24.5 percent.


Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow to net income conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the potential significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding global supply chain challenges, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, the impact of enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow to net income conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, statements regarding diluted income per share, expected dividend payments, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, the impact of recent or potential acquisitions and/or divestitures, and the Company’s 2024 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include those that are detailed in ITW’s Form 10-K for 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
