Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
February 1, 2019
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2018
fourth quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents certain financial measures for 2017 excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also excluded the $658 million income tax charge from the effective tax rate for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the $95 million confidential legal settlement from the calculation of ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, IL., February 1, 2019
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results.
“The fourth quarter closed out another year of strong execution and financial performance by the ITW team. For the quarter, the company delivered 10 percent EPS growth excluding currency impact and the 2017 tax charge, operating margin expansion of 70 basis points and after-tax return on invested capital of 27.7 percent,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
“For the year, excluding the 2017 one-time items, we grew EPS by 15 percent, expanded operating margin by 60 basis points to a record 24.3 percent, grew Free Cash Flow 10 percent and returned $3 billion cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The fact that we achieved these results despite significant raw material cost headwinds and a decline in auto builds in North America, Europe and China clearly demonstrates the power of ITW’s highly differentiated business model and the resilience of our high quality diversified business portfolio.”
“We enter 2019 well-positioned to deliver another year of differentiated performance and continued progress in executing our long-term strategy to leverage the power of the ITW Business Model to its full potential,” Santi concluded.
Fourth-quarter revenue was essentially flat at $3.6 billion as organic growth of one percent was more than offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth increased four percent in North America, offset by a two percent decline in International. As expected, Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by 90 basis points. Excluding a tax charge in the prior year, fourth quarter EPS increased eight percent to $1.83. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $(0.04) and one-time 2017 tax charge, EPS grew 10 percent. Operating margin was 24.0 percent, an increase of 70 basis points, with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points and more than offsetting 40 basis points of price/cost headwind. Fourth quarter Free Cash Flow increased 18 percent to $727 million.
Full year revenue grew three percent to $14.8 billion, with organic growth of two percent. As previously disclosed, the company recorded a favorable legal settlement of $95 million in 2017. Excluding this settlement and the 2017 fourth quarter tax charge, 2018 full-year EPS increased 15 percent to $7.60. Operating margin was 24.3 percent, an increase of 60 basis points excluding the 2017 legal settlement, with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting 50 basis points of price/cost headwind. After-tax return on invested capital was 28.2 percent, an improvement of 390 basis points.
2018 Free Cash Flow increased 10 percent to $2.4 billion. The company repurchased $2 billion of its own shares and raised its dividend 28 percent in August 2018 to an annualized $4.00 per share.
2019 Guidance
The company re-affirmed its full-year EPS guidance in a range of $7.90 to $8.20 per share. Organic growth is expected to be in the range of one to three percent based on current run rates. Operating margin is expected to improve by approximately 100


basis points with enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be at or above 100 percent of net income. The company expects to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its shares in 2019.
For the first quarter 2019, the company expects EPS of $1.73 to $1.83. This incorporates higher estimated restructuring expense of $0.07 per share, foreign currency translation headwind of $0.07 per share and a tax rate in the range of 24.5 to 25.5 percent, which represents a $0.05 per share headwind year-over-year.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.
Forward-looking Statement
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding diluted earnings per share, foreign exchange rates, total and organic revenue growth, operating margin, economic and regulatory conditions in various geographic regions, price/cost impact, restructuring expenses, free cash flow, effective tax rate, after-tax return on invested capital, and timing and amount of share repurchases. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

The 2017 results have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit costs. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the presentation of $4 million and $9 million of other net periodic benefit income in Other income (expense) rather than in Operating Income for the fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017, respectively, with no change in Net Income.
ROIC for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was 27.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points. ROIC for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was 28.2%, an improvement of 390 basis points. The improvement in both periods was primarily the result of the new U.S. tax rules and regulations.
A reconciliation of the 2018 effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding the third quarter 2018 net discrete tax benefit is as follows:

The 2017 results have been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018 related to the presentation of net periodic benefit costs. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the presentation of $4 million and $9 million of other net periodic benefit income in Other income (expense) rather than in Operating Income for the fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017, respectively, with no change in Net Income.
