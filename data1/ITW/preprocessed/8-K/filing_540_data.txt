Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
April 26, 2018
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2018
first
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents certain financial measures for 2017 excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit
Exhibit 99.1
ITW Delivers $1.90 Earnings per Share, up 23%
Raises guidance for 2018 after solid Q1 financial results


	
•	GAAP EPS was $1.90, up 23% versus prior year
	
•	Total revenue was $3.7 billion, an increase of 8%; organic growth was 3%
	
•	Operating margin was 24.1%, an increase of 90 bps
	
•	Operating income was up 12% to $903 million and after-tax ROIC was 27.7%
	
•	Raising full year guidance by $0.15 at the midpoint, up 17% versus prior year
GLENVIEW, Ill., April 26, 2018
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.90 per share, a 23% increase compared to the year ago period. Revenue was up 8% with 3% organic growth.
Operating income was $903 million in the quarter, an increase of 12 percent, and operating margin was 24.1 percent, an increase of 90 basis points. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting 50 basis points of unfavorable price/cost margin impact. While price/cost impact was dilutive to margin percentage, on a dollar basis pricing actions more than offset the impact of raw material cost inflation.
“We are off to a solid start in 2018,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite lower than expected auto builds impacting our Automotive OEM segment, we delivered three percent organic revenue growth which, along with strong execution on our enterprise initiatives and disciplined price/cost management, resulted in operating earnings growth of 12 percent year on year for the quarter. As we look ahead at the balance of the year, the combination of ITW’s resilient high quality business portfolio, positive underlying demand trends, and additional benefits from enterprise initiatives have the company well positioned for continued top and bottom line growth. As a result, we are raising our full year EPS guidance by $0.15 at the mid-point.”
All seven of the company’s business segments delivered positive year on year organic growth, led by Welding (+8 percent), Test & Measurement and Electronics (+8 percent) and Construction Products (+3 percent).
After-tax return on invested capital was 27.7 percent, an improvement of 400 basis points, of which 350 basis points is a result of the new U.S tax rules and regulations.
In the first quarter, Free Cash Flow was $444 million, an increase of 11 percent. The company repurchased $500 million of its own shares.
2018 Guidance
ITW is raising its 2018 full-year guidance by $0.15 at the mid-point to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share, up from prior guidance of $7.45 to $7.65 per share, reflecting 17 percent EPS growth year on year at the midpoint. The company expects organic growth of three to four percent, operating margin in the range of 25 to 25.5 percent, free cash flow at or above 100 percent of net income, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent for the year.
For the second quarter 2018, the company expects earnings to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.00 per share, up 15 percent at the mid-point, with organic growth of three to four percent.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.
Forward-looking Statement
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding diluted earnings per share, organic revenue growth, operating margin, free cash flow, effective tax rate, after-tax return on invested capital, timing and amount of share repurchases and expected dividend payout ratio. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Such factors include those contained in ITW's Form 10-K for 2017.

GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (UNAUDITED)
IMPACT OF THE "TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT" AND LEGAL SETTLEMENT ON 2017 RESULTS
Following the passing of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” in the U.S., ITW recorded a one-time tax charge of $658 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, as previously disclosed, ITW entered into a confidential legal settlement, resulting in a favorable one-time benefit of $95 million in 2017. The following schedule illustrates the impact of these items on the Company’s full-year 2017 financial results:

(1)	Full year 2017 has been restated to reflect the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018 which resulted in the presentation of $9 million of other net periodic benefit income in Other income (expense) rather than in Operating Income, with no change in Net Income.
