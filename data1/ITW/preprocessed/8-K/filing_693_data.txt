Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 20, 2016
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2016
third
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies
. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Operating income of $808 million was up 6%, and after-tax return on invested capital increased by 140 basis points to 23%. Organic revenue increased 2% and the company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point.
"The ITW team delivered another quarter of quality execution and earnings growth marked by all-time record operating income and continued strong margin expansion driven by our Enterprise Strategy initiatives. In addition, continued progress in executing our pivot to growth in combination with our diversified portfolio of seven highly differentiated businesses allowed us to deliver positive organic growth in the third quarter despite a macro environment that remains challenging,” said E.
