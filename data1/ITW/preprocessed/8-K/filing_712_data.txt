Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 20, 2016
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2016
second
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies
. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports Record Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results


	
•	GAAP EPS of $1.46 +12%, $0.07 above guidance mid-point
	
•	Record quarterly performance for operating margin (23.1%), operating income ($792 million), and after-tax ROIC (22.9%)
	
•	Organic revenue +1%, +2% excluding Product Line Simplification
	
•	Raising full-year 2016 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10
GLENVIEW, Ill., July 20, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported second quarter 2016 diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, a 12% increase compared to the year-ago period. Operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.1%, operating income of $792 million was up 8%, and after-tax return on invested capital increased by 260 basis points to 22.9%. Second quarter results for all three of these key metrics were all-time highs for the company. Organic revenue increased 2% excluding Product Line Simplification (PLS) as six of the company’s seven segments delivered positive year on year growth, while the overall demand environment in the Welding segment remained challenging with revenue down 11% in the quarter. The company’s ongoing PLS activities reduced overall organic revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage-point resulting in net organic growth for the company of 1% in the quarter.
"I am very pleased with ITW’s performance in the quarter. The fact that we achieved best ever operating income, operating margin, and return on invested capital performance reinforces both our conviction in the strength of the differentiated performance potential that resides within the ITW Business Model and the excellent progress that our ITW colleagues around the world continue to make in positioning the company to leverage it to its full potential.” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "I am also pleased with the progress that our segments are making in executing our framework for accelerated organic revenue growth, as evidenced by the fact that six of our seven segments delivered positive year on year organic growth in the quarter. As a result, we were able to overcome the continued challenging demand environment in our Welding segment and deliver 12% earnings per share growth.”
Second Quarter Highlights
	
•	GAAP EPS of $1.46 increased 12%, $0.07 above guidance mid-point.
	
•	Operating margin increased 180 basis points to an all-time quarterly record of 23.1%. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points.
	
•	Operating income was up 8% to an all-time quarterly record of $792 million.
	
•	Total revenue was $3.4 billion, down 0.1%. Currency translation reduced revenue by 1.3%.
	
•	Organic revenue grew 1.2%, as North America grew 0.4% and International grew 2.2%.
	
•	After-tax return on invested capital improved 260 basis points to an all-time record of 22.9%.
	
•	Free cash flow was up 23% compared to the year-ago period and conversion of 90% of net income was in line with normal seasonality.
	
•	The company repurchased shares for $500 million and paid $198 million in dividends.
	
•	Six of seven segments achieved positive organic revenue growth as Food Equipment grew 5%, Automotive OEM grew 4%, Test & Measurement/Electronics and Construction Products both grew 3%, Polymers & Fluids grew 2% and Specialty Products grew 0.3%. Welding declined by 11%.
	
•	Five of seven segments improved operating margin with Construction Products up 440 basis points to 24.3%, Food Equipment up 300 basis points to 25.0%, Test & Measurement/Electronics and Specialty Products up 250 basis points to 18.6% and 26.0% respectively, and Automotive OEM up 130 basis points to 25.8%. Polymers & Fluids was unchanged at 20.9% and Welding declined 120 basis points to 24.9%, both due to higher restructuring.
2016 Guidance
ITW is raising its 2016 full-year GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $5.50 to $5.70, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the mid-point. The company is also narrowing its full-year organic growth forecast to 1 to 2% (prior forecast of 1 to 3%) as a result of the lingering difficult market conditions being experienced by the Welding segment. Consistent with prior guidance, the forecast includes approximately 1%-point of PLS impact. Operating margin is expected to exceed 22.5% for the full year. Guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates and includes the expected impact of the Engineered Fasteners & Components (EF&C) acquisition.
On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of EF&C for approximately $450 million. In the second half of 2016, EF&C is expected to add revenues of approximately $220 to $240 million. After acquisition accounting, EF&C is expected to have no EPS impact in the second half of 2016.

PAGE NUMBER: 2

For the third quarter 2016, the company expects GAAP EPS to be in a range of $1.42 to $1.52, and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Organic revenue is forecast to be up 1 to 3%.
