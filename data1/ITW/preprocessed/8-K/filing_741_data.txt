Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
April 20, 2016
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2016
first
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Company’s presentation from the
quarter conference call held on
is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies
. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

•	Organic revenue grew 1 percent, 2 percent excluding Product Line Simplification
	
•	Raising full-year 2016 guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point
GLENVIEW, Ill., April 20, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported first quarter 2016 diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29, a 7 percent increase compared to the year-ago period. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 22.1 percent and organic revenue increased 1 percent. The company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic revenue growth by 1 percentage-point.
"We are pleased with ITW’s strong start to 2016,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In a challenging environment, the company continued to deliver meaningful improvement in all of our key performance metrics: organic growth, EPS, operating margin, return on invested capital, and free cash flow. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to execute the steps necessary to position the company to deliver solid above-market organic growth with best-in-class margins and returns. In the current economic environment and over the long-term, ITW’s unique business model and our proven track record of operational execution position us very well for continued differentiated performance.”
First Quarter Highlights
	
•	GAAP EPS increased 7 percent to $1.29. Excluding $(0.04) impact from foreign currency translation, EPS would have been up 10 percent.
	
•	Operating margin increased 120 basis points to a first quarter record of 22.1 percent as Enterprise Initiatives contributed 130 basis points.
	
•	Organic revenue grew 1 percent as North America grew 2 percent and International declined 1 percent. Consumer-facing businesses grew 3 percent and Industrial-facing businesses declined 3 percent. Total revenue was $3.3 billion, a decline of 2 percent due to the impact of foreign currency.
	
•	After-tax return on invested capital improved 180 basis points to a first quarter record of 21.2 percent.
	
•	Free cash flow conversion was 90 percent.
	
•	Five of seven segments achieved positive organic revenue growth as Construction Products grew 5 percent, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, and Specialty Products all grew 3 percent, and Polymers and Fluids 1 percent. Welding and Test & Measurement Electronics declined by 9 and 2 percent, respectively.
	
•	Six of seven segments increased operating margin with Automotive OEM up 140 basis points to 26.4 percent, Food Equipment up 190 basis points to 24.5 percent, Test & Measurement Electronics up 80 basis points to 15.5 percent, Polymers & Fluids up 20 basis points to 20.2 percent, Construction Products up 440 basis points to 21.0 percent, and Specialty Products up 350 basis points to 26.1 percent. Welding declined 300 basis points to 23.9 percent.
2016 Guidance
The company is raising its 2016 full-year GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.05 to $5.40 to $5.60, which represents a 7 percent increase at the mid-point. The organic revenue growth forecast is unchanged at 1 to 3 percent and includes approximately 1 percentage-point of PLS impact. Operating margin is now projected to exceed 22.5 percent, an increase of more than 100 basis points. Enterprise Initiatives are expected to improve operating margin by more than 100 basis points.
For the second quarter 2016, the company expects GAAP EPS to be in a range of $1.34 to $1.44, an increase of 7 percent at the mid-point, and operating margin to be approximately 22.5 percent. Organic revenue is forecast to be flat to up 2 percent.
