Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
(a)
At its December 11, 2015 meeting, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s By-Laws in order to implement “proxy access,” which allows the Company’s eligible stockholders to include their own director nominees in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials under the circumstances set forth in the By-Laws. New Section 12 was added to Article II of the By-Laws and provides that up to 20 stockholders owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock for at least three years may nominate up to the greater of 25% of the Board of Directors or two directors, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. The amended and restated By-Laws approved by the Board became effective immediately upon approval.
The amended and restated By-Laws also include updates to Section 10(c) and Section 11 of Article II to reflect the Company’s implementation of proxy access.
A copy of the Company’s By-laws, as amended and restated and marked to show the changes from the By-Laws immediately prior to the amendments, is included as Exhibit 3(b)(i) hereto. A clean copy of the Company’s
By-Laws,
as amended and restated, is included as Exhibit 3(b)(ii) hereto. The above description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amended and restated
By-Laws
filed as an exhibit to this Report.

-3-


to vote at the meeting, and (z) complies with the notice procedures as to such business or nomination set forth in this section 10.
Clause (iii) of this paragraph shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and included in the corporation’s notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of stockholders.
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 10, such other business must be a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware corporation law, and the stockholder must have given timely notice of such nomination or other business in writing to the secretary of the corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day and not later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting and the tenth (10th) day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation.
In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.
To be in proper form, a stockholder’s notice to the secretary must set forth:
(i) the following as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or business proposal is made:
(a) the name and address of such stockholder, as it appears on the corporation’s books, and of the beneficial owner, if any;
(b) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, as of the date of such notice (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date);
-4-


(c) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of such notice by, or on behalf of, the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, or any of their affiliates or associates, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, or any of their affiliates or associates with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, and a representation that the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, will notify the corporation in writing of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed; and
(d) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
(ii) the following if the notice relates to any business other than the nomination of a director that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting:
(a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest of such stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, in such business; and
(b) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder; and
(iii) the following as to each person whom the stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director:
(a) the name, age, and business and residential addresses of such person;
-5-


(b) the principal occupation or employment of such person;
(c) the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation beneficially owned by such person;
(d) a statement that such person is willing to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected;
(e) a statement as to whether such person, if elected, intends to comply with the procedures established by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting;
(f) such other information regarding such person that would be required to be included under the proxy solicitation rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had the board of directors nominated such nominee; and
(g) an undertaking to provide such other information as the corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting of stockholders pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting.
Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only if directors are to be elected at such meeting pursuant to the corporation’s notice of meeting.
To be properly brought before a special meeting, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors must be (a) made by or at the direction of the board of directors or (b) provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, made by any stockholder of the corporation who (x) is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this section 10 and at the time of the special meeting, (y) is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (z) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section 10.
Clause (b) of this paragraph shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations for director before a special meeting of stockholders.
-6-


For nominations to be properly brought before a special meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding paragraph, the stockholder must have given timely notice of the nomination to the secretary of the corporation in the form required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section 10.
To be timely, a stockholder’s notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting and the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting.
In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder’s notice as described above.
(c) General.
(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 10 shall be eligible to be elected as directors at a meeting of stockholders, and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 10.
Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 10 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this section 10, to declare that such
proposal
proposed nomination or business
shall be disregarded.
Nothing in this section 10 shall preclude the board of directors or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee either from making nominations for the election of directors or from excluding the person nominated by a stockholder from the slate of directors presented to the meeting.
(2) For purposes of this section 10, “public announcement” shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the PR Newswire or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(3) Nothing in this section 10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of (i) stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) the holders of any series of preferred stock if and to the extent provided for under law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws.
-7-


SECTION 11.
Election of Directors
.
Except as provided in article III, section 8 of these by-laws, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the board of directors in compliance with the
advance notice
requirements
for stockholder nominees for director
set forth in article II, section 10
or article II, section 12, as applicable,
of these by-laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder as of a date that is ten
(10)
days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented).
For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” that director.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has established procedures regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting.
SECTION 12. Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these by-laws, the corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the “Stockholder Nominee”) to the board of directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders that satisfies the requirements of this section 12, including qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this section 12 (a “Proxy Access Notice”) to have its nominee included in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12. For the purposes of this section 12:
(1) “Voting Stock” shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors;
(2) “Constituent Holder” shall mean any stockholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined below) or qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below);
-8-


(3) “affiliate” and “associate” shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the term “partner” as used in the definition of “associate” shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and
(4) a stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the stockholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder’s or Constituent Holder’s (or any of either’s affiliate’s) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder’s (including any Constituent Holder’s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that in all such cases is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings.
-9-


(b) For purposes of this section 12, the “Required Information” that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the corporation determines is required to be disclosed in the corporation’s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these by-laws notwithstanding, the corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(c) To be timely, a stockholder’s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the corporation within the time periods applicable to stockholder notices of nominations pursuant to article II, section 10(a)(2) of these by-laws. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.
(d) The number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the board of directors decides to nominate as board of directors’ nominees) appearing in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 25% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 12 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
(1) the number of such director candidates for which the corporation shall have received one or more valid stockholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to article II, section 10 of these by-laws;
(2) the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of
-10-


Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (2) equals or exceeds one (1); and
(3) the number of directors in office that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the corporation’s proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this section 12, other than any such director referred to in this clause (3) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;
provided, further, in the event that, as a result of one or more vacancies, the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(e) An “Eligible Stockholder” is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this section 12, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer (a “Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the
-11-


aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (e), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this section 12. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this section 12 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder’s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on the dates referred to above and through the date of the applicable annual meeting (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).

The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has established procedures regarding the tender of resignations to the board of directors to address majority voting.
SECTION 12.
Inclusion of Stockholder Director Nominations in the Corporation’s Proxy Materials
.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these by-laws, the corporation shall include in its proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the “Stockholder Nominee”) to the board of directors by a stockholder or group of stockholders that satisfies the requirements of this section 12, including qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below), and that expressly elects at the time of providing the written notice required by this section 12 (a “Proxy Access Notice”) to have its nominee included in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12. For the purposes of this section 12:
(1) “Voting Stock” shall mean outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally for the election of directors;
(2) “Constituent Holder” shall mean any stockholder, collective investment fund included within a Qualifying Fund (as defined below) or beneficial holder whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as holding the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (as defined below) or qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder (as defined below);
(3) “affiliate” and “associate” shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Rule 405 under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that the term “partner” as used in the definition of “associate” shall not include any limited partner that is not involved in the management of the relevant partnership; and
-8-


(4) a stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares of Voting Stock as to which the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) possesses both (a) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (b) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The number of shares calculated in accordance with the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall be deemed not to include (and to the extent any of the following arrangements have been entered into by affiliates of the stockholder (or of any Constituent Holder), shall be reduced by) any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates) pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of Voting Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, or if exercised by either party thereto would have, the purpose or effect of (i) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder’s or Constituent Holder’s (or any of either’s affiliate’s) full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (ii) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or Constituent Holder (or any of either’s affiliates), other than any such arrangements solely involving an exchange listed multi-industry market index fund in which Voting Stock represents at the time of entry into such arrangement less than 10% of the proportionate value of such index. A stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder itself (or such Constituent Holder itself) retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and the right to direct the disposition thereof and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder’s (including any Constituent Holder’s) ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which such person has loaned such shares or delegated any voting power over such shares by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that in all such cases is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings.
(b) For purposes of this section 12, the “Required Information” that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (1) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that the corporation determines is required to be disclosed
-9-


in the corporation’s proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (2) if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Statement (as defined below). The corporation shall also include the name of the Stockholder Nominee in its proxy card. For the avoidance of doubt, and any other provision of these by-laws notwithstanding, the corporation may in its sole discretion solicit against, and include in the proxy statement its own statements or other information relating to, any Eligible Stockholder and/or Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation with respect to the foregoing.
(c) To be timely, a stockholder’s Proxy Access Notice must be delivered to the principal executive offices of the corporation within the time periods applicable to stockholder notices of nominations pursuant to article II, section 10(a)(2) of these by-laws. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, the date of which has been announced by the corporation, commence a new time period for the giving of a Proxy Access Notice.
(d) The number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the board of directors decides to nominate as board of directors’ nominees) appearing in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (x) two (2) and (y) the largest whole number that does not exceed 25% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 12 (such greater number, the “Permitted Number”); provided, however, that the Permitted Number shall be reduced by:
(1) the number of such director candidates for which the corporation shall have received one or more valid stockholder notices nominating director candidates pursuant to article II, section 10 of these by-laws;
(2) the number of directors in office or director candidates that in either case will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting as an unopposed (by the corporation) nominee pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or other understanding with any stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of Voting Stock, by such stockholder or group of stockholders, from the corporation), other than any such director referred to in this clause (2) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms, but only to the extent the Permitted Number after such reduction with respect to this clause (2) equals or exceeds one (1); and
-10-


(3) the number of directors in office that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to such annual meeting for whom access to the corporation’s proxy materials was previously provided pursuant to this section 12, other than any such director referred to in this clause (3) who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the board of directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;
provided, further, in the event that, as a result of one or more vacancies, the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board effective on or prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this section 12 exceeds the Permitted Number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Voting Stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Proxy Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.
(e) An “Eligible Stockholder” is one or more stockholders of record who own and have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3) years as of both the date that the Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this section 12, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, at least three percent (3%) of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the “Proxy Access Request Required Shares”), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer (a “Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (e), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this section 12. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this section 12 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by
-11-


beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an Eligible Stockholder’s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three (3)-year period ending on the dates referred to above and through the date of the applicable annual meeting (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met).
(f) No later than the final date when a nomination pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, an Eligible Stockholder (including each Constituent Holder) must provide the following information in writing to the Secretary of the corporation:
(1) with respect to each Constituent Holder, the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(i) of these by-laws;
(2) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the shares are or have been held during the requisite three (3)-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven (7) calendar days prior to the date the Proxy Access Notice is delivered to the corporation, such person owns, and has owned continuously for the preceding three (3) years, the Proxy Access Request Required Shares, and such person’s agreement to provide:
(a) within ten (10) days after the record date for the annual meeting, written statements from the record holder and intermediaries verifying such person’s continuous ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the record date, together with any additional information reasonably requested to verify such person’s ownership of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares; and
(b) immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Proxy Access Request Required Shares prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting of stockholders;
(3) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the preceding three (3) years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder) and its or their respective affiliates and associates, or
-12-


others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee(s), and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including but not limited to all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if the Eligible Stockholder (including any Constituent Holder), or any affiliate or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the “registrant” for purposes of such rule and the Stockholder Nominee were a director or executive officer of such registrant;
(4) a representation that such person:
(a) acquired the Proxy Access Request Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control of the corporation, and does not presently have such intent;
(b) has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the board of directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Stockholder Nominee(s) being nominated pursuant to this section 12;
(c) has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) under the Exchange Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the annual meeting other than its Stockholder Nominee(s) or a nominee of the board of directors;
(d) will not distribute to any stockholder any form of proxy for the annual meeting other than the form distributed by the corporation; and
(e) will provide facts, statements and other information in all communications with the corporation and its stockholders that are and will be true and correct in all material respects and do not and will not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will otherwise comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this section 12;
(5) in the case of a nomination by a group of stockholders that together constitutes an Eligible Stockholder, the designation by all group members of one group member that is authorized to act on behalf of all members of the nominating stockholder group with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination; and
-13-


(6) an undertaking that such person agrees to:
(a) assume all liability stemming from, and indemnify and hold harmless the corporation and each of its directors, officers and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Stockholder’s communications with the stockholders of the corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Stockholder provided to the corporation; and
(b) file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission any solicitation by the Eligible Stockholder of stockholders of the corporation relating to the annual meeting at which the Stockholder Nominee will be nominated.
In addition, no later than the final date on which a Proxy Access Notice may be submitted under this section 12, a Qualifying Fund whose stock ownership is counted for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder must provide to the Secretary of the corporation documentation reasonably satisfactory to the board of directors that demonstrates that the funds included within the Qualifying Fund are either part of the same family of funds or sponsored by the same employer.
In order to be considered timely, any information required by this section 12 to be provided to the corporation must be supplemented (by delivery to the Secretary of the corporation) (1) no later than ten (10) days following the record date for the applicable annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of such record date, and (2) no later than the fifth day before the annual meeting, to disclose the foregoing information as of the date that is no earlier than ten (10) days prior to such annual meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirement to update and supplement such information shall not permit any Eligible Stockholder or other person to change or add any proposed Stockholder Nominee or be deemed to cure any defects or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any defect.
(g) The Eligible Stockholder may provide to the Secretary of the corporation, at the time the information required by this section 12 is originally provided, a written statement for inclusion in the corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting, not to exceed five
-14-


hundred (500) words, in support of the candidacy of such Eligible Stockholder’s Stockholder Nominee (the “Statement”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section 12, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement that it, in good faith, believes: (i) is materially false or misleading or omits to state any material fact, (ii) would violate any applicable law, regulation or listing standard, or (iii) directly or indirectly impugns the character, integrity or personal reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual foundation, with respect to any person.
(h) No later than the final date when a nomination pursuant to this section 12 may be delivered to the corporation, each Stockholder Nominee must:
(1) provide an executed agreement, in a form deemed satisfactory by the board of directors or its designee (which form shall be provided by the corporation reasonably promptly upon written request of a stockholder), that such Stockholder Nominee:
(a) consents to being named in the corporation’s proxy statement and form of proxy card (and will not agree to be named in any other person’s proxy statement or form of proxy card) as a nominee and to serving as a director of the corporation if elected;
(b) agrees, if elected, to adhere to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles of Conduct and any other publicly available corporation policies and guidelines applicable to directors; and
(c) is not and will not become a party to any compensatory, payment or other financial agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity in connection with his or her nomination, service or action as a director of the corporation, or any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity as to how the Stockholder Nominee would vote or act on any issue or question as a director, in each case that has not been disclosed to the corporation;
(2) complete, sign and submit all questionnaires, representations and agreements required by these by-laws and of the corporation’s directors generally, including providing the information required by article II, section 10(a)(2)(iii) of these by-laws; and
-15-


(3) provide such additional information as necessary to permit the board of directors to determine if such Stockholder Nominee:
(a) is independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the corporation’s directors;
(b) has any direct or indirect relationship with the corporation other than those relationships that have been deemed categorically immaterial pursuant to the corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines;
(c) would, by serving on the board of directors, violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is then listed or any applicable law, rule or regulation; and
(d) has been, is or would be subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (or successor rule) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or the Stockholder Nominee to the corporation or its stockholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, each Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of the corporation of any defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies (including without limitation under these by-laws) available to the corporation relating to any such defect.
(i) Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the corporation’s proxy statement for a particular annual meeting of stockholders, but subsequently is determined not to satisfy the eligibility requirements of this section 12 or any other provision of the corporation’s by-laws, Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable regulation any time before the annual meeting of stockholders, will not be eligible for election at the relevant annual meeting of stockholders.
-16-


(j) The corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, to allow the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee (notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation):
(1) who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing independence of the corporation’s directors, in each case as determined by the board of directors;
(2) whose service as a member of the board of directors would violate or cause the corporation to be in violation of these by-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the corporation is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation;
(3) who is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914;
(4) if the Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder) or applicable Stockholder Nominee otherwise breaches or fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations pursuant to this section 12 or any agreement, representation or undertaking required by this section 12; or
(5) if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to be an Eligible Stockholder for any reason, including but not limited to not owning the Proxy Access Request Required Shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting.
(k) For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph (j), clauses (1), (2) and (3) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by the Stockholder Nominee, clause (4), will result in the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of the specific Stockholder Nominee to whom the ineligibility applies, or, if the proxy statement already has been filed, the ineligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to be nominated; provided, however, that clause (5) and, to the extent related to a breach or failure by an Eligible Stockholder (or any Constituent Holder), clause (4), will result in the Voting Stock owned by such Eligible Stockholder (or Constituent Holder) being excluded from the Proxy Access Request Required Shares (and, if as a result the Proxy Access Notice shall no longer have been filed by an Eligible
-17-


Stockholder, the exclusion from the proxy materials pursuant to this section 12 of all of the applicable stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees from the applicable annual meeting of stockholders or, if the proxy statement has already been filed, the ineligibility of all of such stockholder’s Stockholder Nominees to be nominated). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this section 12, a Stockholder Nominee in its proxy materials for any special meeting of stockholders.

A majority of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Executive Committee, provided that in the absence or disqualification of any member of the Executive Committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
