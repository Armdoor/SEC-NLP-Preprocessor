Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 21, 2015
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2015
third
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Company’s presentation from the
quarter conference call held on
is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("adjusted ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of adjusted ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results


	
•	EPS of $1.39, up 9 percent; up 18 percent excluding $(0.12) of currency headwinds
	
•	Record operating margin of 22.7 percent, up 180 basis points; Enterprise Initiatives contribute 110 basis points
	
•	Strong free cash flow conversion at 126 percent of net income
	
•	Record after-tax return on invested capital of 21.5 percent
GLENVIEW, Ill., October 21, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported third quarter 2015 diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.39, a 9 percent increase compared to the year-ago period. Organic revenue was down 1.7 percent in the quarter as continued solid organic growth performance in Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products was offset by deteriorating end market trends in Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics. In addition, the company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic growth by 1 percentage-point.
"ITW delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion and earnings per share growth," said E. Scott Santi, chairman and chief executive officer. "In the quarter, ITW set new all-time records for operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital and grew EPS by 9 percent. In addition, free cash flow conversion was very strong at 126 percent. Due to ITW’s unique business model and proven track record of operational execution, the company is well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance in both the current environment and over the long-term.”
Third quarter 2015 enterprise highlights*
	
•	EPS increased 9 percent to $1.39. Excluding $(0.12) impact from foreign currency headwinds, EPS would have been up 18 percent.
	
•	Operating margin increased 180 basis points to a record of 22.7 percent as Enterprise Initiatives contribute 110 basis points.
	
•	Free cash flow was $644 million, 126 percent of net income.
	
•	After-tax return on invested capital improved 140 basis points to a record of 21.5 percent.
	
•	Total revenues of $3.4 billion were down 9 percent primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.
Third quarter 2015 segment performance*
	
•	Automotive OEM organic revenue growth of 5 percent outpaced flat worldwide auto builds. Organic revenue increased 12 percent in Europe, 5 percent in North America and declined 5 percent in China. Operating margin of 25.4 percent was up 200 basis points.
	
•	Construction Products organic revenue increased 4 percent driven by 7 percent growth in North America and 5 percent growth in Asia Pacific. Record operating margin of 23.1 percent was up 420 basis points.
	
•	Food Equipment organic revenue increased 3 percent due to 6 percent growth in North America. Record operating margin of 26.3 percent was an increase of 320 basis points.
	
•	Facing challenging year-over-year comparisons and significant end market weakness, organic revenue in Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics declined by 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
Guidance
The company is reducing its 2015 full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 or 1 percent at the midpoint to reflect current demand levels. The updated EPS range of $5.05 to $5.15 is a year-over-year increase of 9 percent at the midpoint. Excluding the negative currency impact, full-year EPS would be up 18 percent at the midpoint. Organic revenue for the year is projected to be down 1 percent to flat, which includes the expected 1-percentage point of impact from PLS. Operating margin is projected to exceed 21 percent, an increase of more than 100 basis points year-over-year. For the fourth quarter 2015, the company is expecting EPS to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.25 and operating margin to be approximately 21 percent. Fourth quarter organic revenue is forecast to be down 1 to 2 percent, in line with current demand levels.
*All comparisons are to the prior year period.
