Enterprise Strategy
In 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy with the objective of fully leveraging ITW’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance. ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
The foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the ITW Business Model consisting of three core elements:
80/20 Business Process -
The concept of the 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page4_table14.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page4_table15.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page4_table16.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page4_table17.json]
The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns.

Customer-Back Innovation
- ITW’s customer-back approach to innovation builds on the Company’s 80/20 business process to help ITW businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. ITW businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW. The Company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10,000 active patents.
Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture
- ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.
Key Initiatives
ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
Portfolio Management
- The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the Company’s long-term growth and earnings potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.
Another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification. Product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process. In the short-term, product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. Over the long-term, product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue, profitability and returns, and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.
Business Structure Simplification
- The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.
Strategic Sourcing
- The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses.
Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment
On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Effective November 1, 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.
Divestiture of the Industrial Packaging Segment
In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations.
On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.
See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

Competition
With operations in
57
countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the Welding segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and ESAB.
In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most segments. The Company believes that each segment's primary competitive advantages derive from the Company's business model and decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing the Company's 80/20 business process and leveraging its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Automotive OEM segment.
Raw Materials
The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.
Research and Development
Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment all contribute to the Company's organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers' costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or improving the quality of customers' assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $227 million in
2014
, $240 million in
and $240 million in
2012

Intellectual Property
The Company owns approximately 3,400 unexpired U.S. patents and 6,600 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,600 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,100 applications pending in foreign patent offices. There is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains a patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.
The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company's patents would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its success in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.
In addition to patents, many of the Company's products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate.

Environmental
The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows.
Employees
The Company employed approximately 49,000 persons as of
December 31, 2014
and considers its employee relations to be excellent.
International
The Company's international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as automotive OEM/tiers, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, construction, and others on a worldwide basis. The Company's revenues from sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 57% of revenues in
2014
,
2013
and

The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
The Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the Company’s businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in
10


collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.
The global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
The Company currently operates in
57
countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:

If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
The timing and amount of benefits from the Company’s 2013 - 2017 enterprise initiatives may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
The Company’s 2013 - 2017 enterprise strategy and associated initiatives include portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. The portfolio management initiative, which included divesting businesses no longer aligned with the Company’s long-term objectives, is essentially complete; however, product line simplification and customer base simplification, which is a core element of the Company’s 80/20 business process, is being reapplied to the Company’s scaled up operating divisions and remains an active element of this initiative. Although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they may have a negative impact on the Company’s overall organic revenue growth in the short term. The Company has made significant progress on its business structure simplification and strategic sourcing initiatives, but scaling up of smaller businesses into larger businesses and leveraging purchasing power across businesses involves some execution risk. If the Company is unable to achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives or is unable to complete these initiatives without material disruption to its businesses, the timing and amount of benefits from these initiatives may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
The timing and amount of the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.
Share repurchases constitute a significant component of the Company’s capital allocation strategy. The Company funds its share repurchases with free operating cash flow and short-term borrowings. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash.
The Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws.
The Company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the Company’s strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. The Company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. Any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations,
11


could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.
A significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.
Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.
If the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or adequately protect its intellectual property, its future growth may be adversely affected.
The Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position. If the Company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.
Protecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. The Company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.
Recent divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the Company's financial results.
The Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. Though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the Company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters.
The Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
In the past the Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could result that adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.
Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in our credit ratings could increase our funding costs or reduce the availability of credit.
Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. The Company’s continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. In addition, the Company’s borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. If conditions in the financial markets decline or the Company’s credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished.
12


Raw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.
The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and profit margins. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.
The Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
The performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
Potential adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect results.
The Company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.

ITEM 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
INTRODUCTION
Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately 90 divisions in
57
countries. As of December 31, 2014, the Company employed approximately 49,000 persons.
The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and similar end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Test & Measurement and Electronics; Food Equipment; Polymers & Fluids; Welding; Construction Products; and Specialty Products.
Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
Management analyzes the Company's consolidated results of operations and the results of each segment by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the organic business (businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months), newly acquired and recently divested companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. The changes to operating income of organic businesses include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the revenues. Changes in variable margins and overhead costs represent the estimated effect of non-volume related changes in the operating income of organic businesses and may be driven by a number of factors, including changes in product mix, the cost of raw materials, labor and overhead, and pricing to customers. Selling price versus material cost comparisons represent the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. Management reviews these price versus cost comparisons by analyzing the net impact of changes to each segment's operating margin.
ENTERPRISE STRATEGY
In 2012, the Company embarked on an Enterprise Strategy with the objective of fully leveraging ITW’s core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance. ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
The foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the ITW Business Model consisting of three core elements:
80/20 Business Process -
The concept of the 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. The Company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page17_table0.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page17_table1.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page17_table2.json]
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page17_table3.json]
17


The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns.
Customer-Back Innovation
- ITW’s customer-back approach to innovation builds on the Company’s 80/20 business process to help ITW businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. ITW businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW. The Company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10,000 active patents.
Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture
- ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.
KEY INITIATIVES
ITW’s Enterprise Strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. These enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
Portfolio Management
- The Company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the Company’s differentiated business model and growth potential. As part of this initiative, the Company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. As a result, the Company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. With the sale of the Company's former Industrial Packaging segment on May 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the Company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the Company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the Company’s long-term growth and earnings potential. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.
Another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification. Product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the Company's 80/20 business process. In the short-term, product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. Over the long-term, product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue, profitability and returns, and is key to improving the Company's long-term operating and financial performance.
Business Structure Simplification
- The business structure simplification initiative simplifies the Company's organizational model and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on reducing the number of the Company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.
Strategic Sourcing
- The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. It incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the Company's many businesses.

DIVESTITURE OF MAJORITY INTEREST IN FORMER DECORATIVE SURFACES SEGMENT
On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Effective November 1, 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations.
In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations.
On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for
$3.2 billion
. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $
1.7 billion
($
1.1 billion
after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.
In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. The construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.
In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.
The operating results of the businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income for all periods presented. As of the second quarter of 2014, the Company has completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Company’s consolidated results of operations for
2014
,
2013
and
2012
are summarized as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page19_table0.json]
19


In
2014
and
2013
, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page20_table0.json]
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues increased 2.5% in 2014 versus 2013 due to an increase in organic and acquisition revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation which primarily occurred in the fourth quarter. Total organic revenues increased 2.6% in 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to 8.9% growth in the Automotive OEM segment and 4.7% growth in the Food Equipment segment, partially offset by modest declines in the Polymers & Fluids and Specialty Products segments. Product line and customer base simplification activities associated with the portfolio management component of the Company's enterprise strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. International organic revenues increased 3.2% versus the prior year. European organic revenues increased 2.4% primarily driven by the Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, partially offset by Welding, Polymers & Fluids and Construction Products. Asia Pacific organic revenues increased 4.9% primarily due to growth in Automotive OEM in China and Construction Products in Australia. North American organic revenues increased 2.3% primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM, Welding and Food Equipment segments. Acquisitions primarily included the purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business in the third quarter of 2013.
Operating revenues decreased 4.4% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to divestitures which reduced revenues by 6.3% over the prior year. On October 31, 2012, the Company divested a 51% majority interest in the former Decorative Surfaces segment. Accordingly, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Excluding the 2012 revenues of the former Decorative Surfaces segment of $921 million, 2013 revenues increased by $265 million, or 1.9%, over the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenues from acquisitions and higher organic revenues (see "Results of Operations by Segment" table below). Acquisitions contributed 1.7% to revenues in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the purchase of a European consumer packaging equipment business and a Chinese food equipment business. Worldwide organic revenues increased 0.2% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM segment, partially offset by lower revenues in the electronic assembly equipment businesses within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. International organic revenues increased 1.2% due to growth in Asia Pacific of 3.6%, primarily due to the result of strong growth in China in 2013 versus 2012. European organic revenues declined 0.8% due to weakness in the European economic environment in the first half of 2013 which moderately improved in the second half of the year. North American organic revenues were lower by 0.5% primarily due to the electronic assembly business within the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. This was partially offset by growth in the North American Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, and Construction Products businesses.
20


Operating Income
Operating income increased 14.9% in 2014 versus 2013 primarily due to changes in variable margins and overhead costs, an increase in organic revenues and lower restructuring expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation.

The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased organic business margins by 150 basis points driven by the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons of 30 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 40 basis points primarily due to lower operating margins and the impact of intangible asset amortization expense.
Operating income increased 11.7% in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to lower operating expenses, an increase in organic revenues, and income from acquisitions. Total organic business margins increased 160 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to the changes in variable margins and overhead costs and the positive operating leverage effect of the increase in organic revenues of 30 basis points. The changes in variable margins and overhead costs increased organic business margins by 130 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 driven by lower overhead expenses of 120 basis points, primarily resulting from the benefits of business structure simplification activities, and improvements in variable margins of 10 basis points. Acquisitions diluted total operating margins by 60 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 primarily due to amortization expense related to intangible assets.

DECORATIVE SURFACES
The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.
On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the "Investment Agreement") to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart"). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, effective November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.
Historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces for 2012 were as follows:

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $
242 million
in
2014
from $
250 million
2013
and $
252 million
2012
, due to various intangible assets being fully amortized in both 2014 and 2013.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of
,
and
. In the third quarter of 2014, these assessments resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and total indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $3 million in the Polymers & Fluids and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments. In 2013, these assessments resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $2 million in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. In 2012, these assessments resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $1 million in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $1 million in the Food Equipment segment. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense increased to $
, which includes interest expense on the notes issued in February 2014 and the Euro notes issued in May 2014
, versus $
239 million
. Interest expense increased in 2013, which included the full year impact of interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late August 2012, versus $
213 million
in 2012. See the Debt note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details regarding the Company's debt obligations.
GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN DECORATIVE SURFACES
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) related to the sale of a 51% majority interest in the former Decorative Surfaces segment. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)
Other income (expense) was income of $
61 million
in
2014
versus $
72 million
2013
. This decrease was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $
30 million
recorded in
related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment, partially offset by higher interest income ($
65 million
50 million
).
11 million
2012
. This increase was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $
recorded in the first quarter of
related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment, higher interest income ($
38 million
) and lower equity investment losses related to Wilsonart ($
14 million
See the Other Income (Expense) note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details.
INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate was
30.0%
,
30.6%
, and
30.3%
. The effective tax rate for 2013 was unfavorably impacted by a $40 million discrete tax charge in the third quarter of 2013 related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2012 was unfavorably impacted by discrete tax charges totaling $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included $35 million for the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009.
See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
For the year ended 2014 versus 2013, the impact of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased operating revenues by approximately $110 million in 2014 and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately $14 million. For the year ended 2013 versus 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar did not have a significant impact on operating revenues or income from continuing operations.
INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Income from discontinued operations was $
1.1 billion
, $
49 million
and
$637 million
. Income from discontinued operations in 2014 included an after-tax gain of $
on the disposal of the Industrial Packaging business in the second quarter of 2014. Income from discontinued operations in 2013 included after-tax losses on disposals of $72 million and goodwill impairment of
$42 million
related to various divested businesses. Income from discontinued operations in 2012 included an after-tax gain of $372 million related to the sale of the finishing group of businesses. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s discontinued operations.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. The Company adopted this new guidance effective January 1, 2015. The new guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after such date. As a result, this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements or related disclosures upon adoption.
In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had
$4.0 billion
of cash on hand at
December 31, 2014
and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include:

[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page35_table3.json]
In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging business. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. As to the impact of this divestiture on the Company’s income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the Company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. The Company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014. Under this program, the Company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 35.7 million shares of its common stock in the first half of 2014.
On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for
$3.2 billion
. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $
1.7 billion
($
1.1 billion
after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations. A portion of the proceeds was used to fund share repurchases under the program noted above.
The Company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.
Cash Flow
The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Summarized cash flow information for the years ended December 31,
2014
,
2013
and
2012
was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page35_table4.json]
35


The 2014 net cash provided by operating activities included $724 million of tax payments related to the disposition of the Industrial Packaging segment. Cash dividends paid during 2013 do not include the dividend payment of $174 million originally scheduled to be paid in January 2013, which was accelerated and paid in December 2012.
Stock Repurchase Programs
On May 6, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to
$4.0
billion of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2011 Program"). Under the 2011 Program, the Company repurchased approximately
1.8
million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20 per share during 2011, approximately
35.5
million shares of its common stock at an average price of
$56.93
per share during 2012 and approximately
26.4 million
shares of its common stock at an average price of
$71.89
per share during 2013. As of
December 31, 2013
, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 Program.
On August 2, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to an additional
$6.0 billion
of the Company’s common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2013 Program"). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately
3.3 million
$81.62
per share during 2013 and approximately
50.4 million
$84.92
per share during 2014. As of
December 31, 2014
, there was approximately
$1.4 billion
of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 Program.
Adjusted Return on Average Invested Capital
The Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("adjusted ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. To improve comparability of adjusted ROIC in the periods presented, after-tax operating income excludes the operating income of the former Decorative Surfaces segment. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Decorative Surfaces and Industrial Packaging segments, and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
36


Adjusted ROIC for the years ended December 31,
2014
,
2013
, and
2012
was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page37_table0.json]
Adjusted ROIC increased 260 basis points in
versus
as a result of improvement in after-tax operating income of 13.0% and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 2.6%. Adjusted ROIC increased 180 basis points in
as a result of improvement in after-tax operating income of 8.4% and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 3.7%.
The 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $40 million related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. The 2012 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $36 million, which included $35 million for the settlement of an IRS tax audit for the years 2008-2009.
A reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding the discrete tax items is as follows:

Working Capital
Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital at December 31,
2014
and
2013
is summarized as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page38_table0.json]
The increase in net working capital as of December 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower current maturities of long-term debt resulting from the repayment of $1.0 billion of 5.25% Euro notes in October 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes in April 2014, partially offset by a $1.5 billion decrease in net assets held for sale primarily related to the sale of the Industrial Packaging business.
Cash and equivalents totaled approximately $4.0 billion as of
December 31, 2014
and $3.6 billion as of
December 31, 2013
, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S.
Debt
Total debt at December 31,
was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page38_table1.json]
Short-term debt as of
included commercial paper of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, at
the Company classified €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 as short-term debt, which were repaid on the respective due dates.
38


In February 2014, the Company issued $
650 million
of
0.9%
notes due February 25, 2017 at 99.861% of face value, $
1.95%
notes due March 1, 2019 at 99.871% of face value, and $
700 million
3.5%
notes due March 1, 2024 at 99.648% of face value. Net proceeds from the February 2014 debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper.
In May 2014, the Company issued €
500 million
1.75%
Euro notes due May 20, 2022 at 99.16% of face value and €
3.0%
Euro notes due May 19, 2034 at 98.089% of face value. The carrying values of the Euro notes were $600 million and $594 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Net proceeds from the May 2014 debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes.
The Company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. The Company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of August 15, 2018 and $1.5 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017. No amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at
December 31, 2014
. The maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during
2014
was $2.3 billion, while the average daily balance was $858 million. As of
, the Company's foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of
$330 million
.
Total Debt to EBITDA
The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.
Total debt to EBITDA for the years ended December 31,
and
2013
was as follows:

December 31, 2014
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page40_table0.json]
As of
, the Company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $157 million.
The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments at
.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. Various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company's critical accounting policies are as follows:
Realizability of Inventories
—
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Company’s businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page40_table1.json]
In addition, for approximately 22% of total inventories, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method due to the effects of inflation.
Collectibility of Accounts Receivable
The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.
Depreciation of Plant and Equipment
The Company’s U.S. businesses primarily compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page40_table2.json]
The majority of the Company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.
40


Income Taxes
—
The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the Company’s total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the Company could incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
As of
December 31, 2014
, the Company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $
6.5 billion
allocated to its reporting units. Although there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Company’s 80/20 business process. The amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $59 million to $1.6 billion, with the average amount equal to $461 million.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Company’s global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. Pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant’s years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. Future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
During 2014, the Society of Actuaries released a new mortality table, referred to as RP-2014, which is believed to better reflect mortality improvements. The Company used the RP-2014 mortality table to measure its U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2014, resulting in an increase in pension obligations of $76 million and an increase in other postretirement obligations of $46 million as of December 31, 2014.
The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the U.S. primary pension plan. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $37 million.
The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $4 million.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt. The following table presents the Company’s debt for which fair value is subject to changing market interest rates:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page42_table0.json]
Foreign Currency Risk
The Company operates in the U.S. and
56
foreign countries. The initial funding for the foreign manufacturing operations was provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital from the U.S. parent company. The Company’s products are primarily manufactured and sold within the same country. Therefore, the Company's manufacturing operations do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
In October 2007, the Company, through a wholly-owned European subsidiary, issued €750 million of 5.25% Euro notes due October 1, 2014, which were paid on the due date. In addition, in May 2014, the Company issued €500 million of 1.75% Euro notes due May 20, 2022 and €500 million of 3.0% Euro notes due May 19, 2034. The Company designated the
€1.0 billion
of Euro notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income. The unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedge was $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). ITW’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
ITW management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014
. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we believe that, as of
, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Illinois Tool Works Inc.
Glenview, IL
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, income reinvested in the business, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Financial Statements
The Notes to Financial Statements
furnish additional information on items in the financial statements. The notes have been arranged in the same order as the related items appear in the statements.
Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately
90
divisions in
57
countries.
The Company primarily serves the automotive OEM/tiers, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, and construction end markets.
Significant accounting principles and policies of the Company are in italics. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year reporting.
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements are related to inventories, trade receivables, plant and equipment, income taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, product liability matters, litigation, product warranties, pensions, other postretirement benefits, environmental matters and stock-based compensation.
Consolidation and Translation
—
The financial statements include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company follows the equity method of accounting for investments where the Company has a significant influence but not a controlling interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated from the financial statements. Foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.
Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment
—On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the "Investment Agreement") to divest a
51%
majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $
933
million ($
632
million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC ("Wilsonart"). Through a combination of CD&R’s equity investment in Wilsonart and new third party borrowings by a subsidiary of Wilsonart, the Company and its subsidiaries received payments of approximately $
1.05
billion from Wilsonart and its subsidiaries as well as common units (the "Common Units") initially representing approximately
49%
(on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity of Wilsonart immediately following the closing of the transaction. CD&R contributed $
395
million to Wilsonart in exchange for newly issued cumulative convertible participating preferred units (the "Preferred Units") of Wilsonart initially representing approximately
(on an as-converted basis) of the total outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the transaction. The Preferred Units rank senior to the Common Units as to dividends and liquidation preference, and accrue dividends at a rate of
10.00%
per annum.
As of October 31, 2012, the Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment and now reports its ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded its initial equity investment in Wilsonart at fair value. The fair value was determined using an implied equity value approach, which is a Level 3 valuation method. Under this approach, the total equity of Wilsonart was valued using an option pricing model and the value of the Preferred Units was deducted to arrive at the implied equity value of the Common Units. The significant unobservable inputs utilized in this calculation were the expected term of the investment and assumed volatility during the term. The Company also applied a discount factor to the implied equity value of the Common Units due to the lack of marketability of the Common Units. The fair value of the Company’s retained ownership interest was determined to be $
204
million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $
51
million related to the retained interest, which was included in the pre-tax gain noted above. The Company’s equity investment in Wilsonart is reported in Other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Company’s proportionate share in the income (loss) of Wilsonart is reported in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of income. As the Company’s investment in Wilsonart is structured as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, U.S. taxes are recorded separately from the equity investment. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $
30
million for the two-month period ended December 31, 2012 in Other income (expense) primarily due to transaction costs related to the formation of Wilsonart and the impact of purchase accounting. The Company recorded pre-tax losses of
$9
49


million
and
$14 million
for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in Other income (expense) related to its interest in Wilsonart.
Due to the Company’s continuing involvement through its
49%
interest in Wilsonart, the historical operating results of Decorative Surfaces are presented in continuing operations. Additionally, as of November 1, 2012, the operating results of Decorative Surfaces are no longer reviewed by senior management of the Company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, Decorative Surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the Company.
Historical operating results of the former Decorative Surfaces segment for 2012 were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page50_table0.json]
Discontinued Operations
—The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations. The following summarizes the Company’s discontinued operations.
Third Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations
-In February 2013, the Company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for its Industrial Packaging segment. In September 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the Industrial Packaging segment. The Company classified the Industrial Packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations.
On February 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its Industrial Packaging business to The Carlyle Group for
$3.2 billion
. The transaction was completed on May 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $
1.7 billion
($
1.1 billion
after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in Income from discontinued operations.
In the third quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the Construction Products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013. The specialty coatings business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2013. The construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.
First Quarter 2013 Discontinued Operations
-In the first quarter of 2013, the Company committed to plans for the divestiture of
two
transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the Specialty Products segment,
construction distribution businesses previously included in the Construction Products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the Polymers & Fluids segment. These businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.
The Company also reclassified certain previously divested businesses as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2013. These included a consumer packaging business that was previously included in the Specialty Products segment, a packaging distribution business which was previously included in the former Industrial Packaging segment, and a welding manufacturing business previously included in the Welding segment.
In the second quarter of 2013, the Company divested
one
of the held for sale transportation related businesses, the machine components business, and the chemical manufacturing business. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company divested the second held for sale transportation related business. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company divested
construction distribution business and the remaining construction distribution business was sold in the second quarter of 2014.
2011 Discontinued Operations
-In April 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its finishing group of businesses included within the Specialty Products segment to Graco Inc. in a
$650 million
cash transaction. The sale of the finishing business to Graco was completed on April 2, 2012.
50


Additionally, in the second quarter of 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved plans to divest a consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment. The consumer packaging business was sold in the third quarter of 2012.
The operating results of the businesses discussed above are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income for all periods presented. Results of the discontinued operations for the years ended December 31,
2014
,
2013
and
2012
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page51_table0.json]
Included in income before income taxes from discontinued operations are net gain on disposal of
$1.7 billion
in 2014, net losses on disposal of
$91 million
in 2013, and net gains of
$499 million
in 2012. The net gain in 2014 included a pre-tax gain of
(
$1.1 billion
after-tax) on the sale of the Industrial Packaging business. The net losses in 2013 included a
$39 million
pre-tax loss related to the sale of
one
of the construction distribution businesses and a
$20 million
of the transportation businesses. The net gains in 2012 included a
$452 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of the finishing group of businesses. Also included in income before income taxes from discontinued operations in 2013 was a
$42 million
goodwill impairment charge recorded in connection with the anticipated sale of
of the transportation related businesses.
In 2014, income tax expense from discontinued operations included
$175 million
of U.S. income tax expense related to the repatriation of approximately
$1.3 billion
of international proceeds from the sale of the Industrial Packaging business. In 2013, income tax expense from discontinued operations included
of tax expense related to the legal restructuring of the Industrial Packaging business.
There were
no
businesses classified as held for sale as of
December 31, 2014
. As of December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of the Industrial Packaging business and the
two
construction distribution businesses discussed above were included in assets and liabilities held for sale in the statement of financial position, as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page51_table1.json]
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. In addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. The Company adopted this new guidance effective January 1, 2015. The new guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after such date. As a result, this guidance did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements or related disclosures upon adoption.
51


Acquisitions
—
The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method, in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired companies are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, did not materially affect the Company’s results of operations or financial position for any period presented. Net cash paid for acquisitions during 2014, 2013, and 2012 was
$45 million
,
$369 million
, and
$723 million
, respectively.
The premium over tangible net assets recorded for acquisitions based on purchase price allocations during
2014
2013
and
2012
was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page52_table0.json]
Of the total goodwill recorded for acquisitions, the Company expects goodwill of
$14 million
in
$25 million
$15
million in
will be tax deductible.
Operating Revenues
are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured,
which is generally at the time of product shipment. Typical sales arrangements are for standard products and provide for transfer of ownership and risk of loss at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances
where significant obligations to the customer are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation and customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been completed. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues.
In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.
Research and Development Expenses
are recorded as expense in the year incurred.
These costs were
$227 million
, $
240 million
$240 million
.
52


Rental Expense
was
$130
million in
2014
,
$138
2013
and
$144
2012
. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases for the years ending December 31 are as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page53_table0.json]
Advertising Expenses
are recorded as expense in the year incurred.
These costs were
$66 million
in
$67
$78
.
Other Income (Expense)
consisted of the following:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page53_table1.json]
On January 31, 2013, the Company acquired the controlling interest of an existing consumer packaging business in the Specialty Products segment previously accounted for under the equity method. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $
30 million
in Other income (expense) in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of remeasuring the Company's existing equity interest to fair value by determining the implied equity value using a Level 3 valuation method.
53


Income Taxes
—
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws.
The components of the provision for income taxes were as shown below:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page54_table0.json]
Income from continuing operations before income taxes for domestic and foreign operations was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page54_table1.json]
The reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page54_table2.json]
Deferred U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the remaining undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries as these earnings are considered permanently invested.
Undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately
$7.1
billion and
$9.0
billion as of December 31,
2014
and
2013
, respectively. Upon repatriation of these earnings to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The actual U.S. tax cost would depend on income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution. Determination of the related tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.
On January 1, 2014 the Company adopted new accounting guidance that requires companies to net unrecognized tax benefits against same-jurisdiction net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that would be used to settle the position with the
54


relevant tax authority. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31,
2014
and
2013
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page55_table0.json]
Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The valuation allowances recorded at December 31,
related primarily to certain net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards.
At
December 31, 2014
, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, which expire as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page55_table1.json]
The Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of
$195
million as of
that are available for use by the Company between 2015 and 2024.
55


The changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during
2014
,
2013
and
2012
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page56_table0.json]
Included in the balance at December 31,
were approximately
$218
million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
During the third quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a discrete tax charge of
$40 million
related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company came to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on issues related predominately to intercompany transactions and global legal structure reorganization transactions identified by the Internal Revenue Service during its 2008-2009 audit. Based on this agreement, the Company decreased its unrecognized tax benefits related to this matter by approximately
$125
million and recorded an unfavorable tax charge of
$35
million.
The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions including the Internal Revenue Service, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately
$44 million
related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues. The following table summarizes the open tax years for the Company’s major jurisdictions:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page56_table1.json]
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
The accrual for interest and penalties as of December 31,
was
$30
million and
$21
million, respectively.
On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency ("NOD") from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of
$70 million
for the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case will proceed to court. Although the outcome of this process cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it will be successful in defending its positions. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter.
Income Per Share from Continuing Operations
is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period. Income from continuing operations per diluted share is computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted-average number of shares assuming dilution for stock options and restricted stock units.
Dilutive shares reflect the potential additional shares that would be outstanding if the dilutive stock options outstanding were exercised and the unvested restricted stock units vested during the period. The
56


computation of income per share from continuing operations was as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page57_table0.json]
Options that were considered antidilutive were not included in the computation of diluted income per share from continuing operations. There were
no
antidilutive options outstanding as of
December 31, 2014
. The number of antidilutive options outstanding as of December 31,
2013
and
2012
was
0.1
million and
million, respectively.
Cash and Equivalents
included interest-bearing instruments of
$3.1 billion
at December 31,
2014
$2.0 billion
.
These interest-bearing instruments have maturities of
three months or less
and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Trade Receivables
were net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. The changes in the allowances for uncollectible accounts during
,
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page57_table1.json]
Inventories
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page57_table2.json]
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material, labor and factory overhead. The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method is used to determine the cost of the inventories at certain U.S. businesses.
The first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, which approximates current cost, is used for all other inventories.
Inventories priced at LIFO were approximately
22%
20%
of total inventories as of December 31,
, respectively. If the FIFO method was used for all inventories, total inventories would have been approximately
$88 million
$85 million
higher than reported at
, respectively.
57


Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets
as of December 31,
2014
and
2013
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page58_table0.json]
Net Plant and Equipment
are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Renewals and improvements that increase the useful life of plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment for financial reporting purposes is primarily computed on an accelerated basis for U.S. businesses and on a straight-line basis for a majority of the international businesses.
Depreciation was
$262
million in
,
$270
$277
2012
, and was reflected primarily in cost of revenues. There was
no
depreciation included in Income from discontinued operations in 2014. Depreciation included in Income from discontinued operations was
$29 million
in
$46
.
Net plant and equipment consisted of the following at December 31,
:

The ranges of useful lives used to depreciate plant and equipment are as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page58_table2.json]
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
—Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses.
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various Level 2 and Level 3 valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill.
The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-of-royalty income approach derived from
58


internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
—The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, predominately in the U.S.
The U.S. primary pension plan provides benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The U.S. primary postretirement health care plan is contributory with the participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The U.S. primary postretirement life insurance plan is noncontributory.
Beginning January 1, 2007, the U.S. primary pension and other postretirement benefit plans were closed to new participants. Newly hired employees and employees from acquired businesses that are not participating in these plans are eligible for additional Company contributions under the existing U.S. primary defined contribution retirement plans. The Company’s expense related to defined contribution plans was
$78 million
in
2014
, $
72
million in
2013
and
$78
2012
.
In addition to the U.S. plans, the Company also has defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries, mainly the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Germany.

Summarized information regarding the Company’s significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans related to both continuing and discontinued operations is as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page64_table0.json]
Net periodic benefit cost was included in the statement of income as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page64_table1.json]
The pension settlement charges in 2013 included
$45 million
tied primarily to higher lump sum pension payments resulting from the exit of Decorative Surfaces employees from the Company's U.S. primary pension plan. These charges were included in Income from continuing operations. Refer to the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Former Decorative Surfaces Segment note for further details regarding the Decorative Surfaces transaction.
In addition, the Company recognized a
$9 million
curtailment gain on the U.S. primary postretirement plan in the second
quarter of 2014 and a
$2 million
curtailment charge on the U.S. primary pension plan in the third quarter of 2013 related to the
Company's sale of the Industrial Packaging business and the reclassification of the Industrial Packaging business to
discontinued operations. These curtailment charges were included in Income from discontinued operations.
During 2014, the Society of Actuaries released a new mortality table, referred to as RP-2014, which is believed to better reflect mortality improvements. The Company used the RP-2014 mortality table to measure its U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2014 which resulted in additional actuarial losses of $
76 million
for pension and $
46 million
for other postretirement benefits.

Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used in the valuations of pension and other postretirement benefits were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page66_table1.json]
The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefit plans were developed using historical asset class returns while factoring in current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and asset class performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care benefit plans. The assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31 were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page67_table0.json]
A one percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following impact:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page67_table1.json]
Plan Assets
The Company’s overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risk at a reasonable level over a long-term investment horizon. In order to reduce unnecessary risk, the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes, securities and investment managers. The target allocations for plan assets are
30%
to
50%
equity securities,
45%
60%
fixed income securities and
0%
10%
in other types of investments. The Company does not use derivatives for the purpose of speculation, leverage, circumventing investment guidelines or taking risks that are inconsistent with specified guidelines.
The assets in the Company’s postretirement health care plan are primarily invested in life insurance policies. The Company’s overall investment strategy for the assets in the postretirement health care fund is to invest in assets that provide a reasonable tax exempt rate of return while preserving capital.
The following tables present the fair value of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31,
2014
and
2013
, by asset category and valuation methodology. Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would be expected to use in pricing the assets. Each financial instrument’s categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Cash and equivalents include cash on hand and investments with maturities of
three months or less
and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Equity securities primarily include common and preferred equity securities covering a wide range of industries and geographies that are traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices. Fixed income securities primarily consist of U.S. and foreign government bills, notes and bonds, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and investment contracts. The majority of the assets in this category are valued by evaluating bid prices provided by independent financial data services. For securities where market data is not readily available, unobservable market data is used to value the security. Commingled funds include investments in public and private pooled funds. Mutual funds are traded in active markets and are valued based on quoted prices. The underlying investments include small-cap equity, international equity and long- and short-term fixed income instruments. Collective trust funds are private funds that are valued at the net asset value, which is determined based on the fair value of the underlying investments. The underlying investments include both passively and actively managed U.S. and foreign large- and mid-cap equity funds and short-term investment funds. Partnerships/private equity interests are investments in partnerships where the benefit plan is a limited partner. The investments are valued by the investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use market, income and cost valuation methods. Life insurance policies are used to fund other postretirement benefits in order to obtain favorable tax treatment and are valued based on the cash surrender value of the underlying policies.

Commitments and Contingencies
—The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including those involving environmental, product liability (including toxic tort) and general liability claims.
The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such accruals are based on developments to date, the Company’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters. The Company believes resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or future operations.
Among the toxic tort cases in which the Company is a defendant, the Company and its subsidiaries Hobart Brothers Company and Miller Electric Mfg. Co. have been named, along with numerous other defendants, in lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding consumables. The plaintiffs in these suits claim unspecified damages for injuries resulting from alleged exposure to asbestos, manganese and/or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process. In the first quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement resolving substantially all of the manganese-related claims for an immaterial amount. As of December 31, 2014, all of the manganese-related cases against the Company, Hobart Brothers and Miller Electric have been dismissed. The Company believes that the remaining asbestos and toxic fumes claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial position or cash flows. The Company has not recorded any significant reserves related to these cases.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
—Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that was issued in February 2013 requiring disclosure of amounts transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of income.
In March 2013, new accounting guidance was issued which clarifies that an entity should release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, which is consistent with the Company's prior accounting policy. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2014 and did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements.
The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income during
were as follows:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page72_table0.json]
Foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified to income are primarily related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations and were included in the related gain or loss upon disposal. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note for additional information regarding the sale of the Company's discontinued operations.
Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income represent the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service cost, and settlement and curtailment charges recognized in net periodic benefit cost. Refer to the Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits note for the amounts included in net periodic benefit cost. Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income also include the reclass of deferred losses of
$6 million
, and
$11 million
for the years ended December 31,
and 2012, respectively, related to the disposal of certain discontinued operations. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note for additional information regarding the sale of the Company's discontinued operations.
As of December 31,
, the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of cumulative translation adjustment expense of
$265 million
and income of
$674 million
, respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs of
$393 million
$290 million
, respectively. The estimated unrecognized benefit cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in
2015
is $
62 million
for pension and other postretirement benefits.

Stock-Based Compensation
—Stock options and restricted stock units have been issued to officers and other management employees under ITW’s 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The stock options generally vest over a
four
-year period and have a maturity of
ten
years from the issuance date. Restricted stock units generally vest after a
three
-year period and include units with and without performance criteria. To cover the exercise of vested options and vesting of restricted stock units in 2012, the Company generally issued new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. Commencing in February 2013, the Company issued shares from treasury stock. At December 31,
2014
, approximately
34 million
shares of ITW common stock were reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock awards over the remaining service periods of those awards.
The following table summarizes the Company’s stock-based compensation expense:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page73_table0.json]
Pre-tax stock-based compensation expense included in income from discontinued operations was

The following table summarizes stock option activity under the Plan for the year ended December 31,
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page73_table2.json]
The Company's annual equity awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs"). The RSUs provide for full "cliff" vesting
years from the date of grant. The PRSUs provide for full "cliff" vesting after
years if the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals set with respect to the PRSUs have been met. Upon vesting, the holder will receive
one
share of common stock of the Company for each vested RSU or PRSU. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the closing market price on the date of the grant by the present value of projected dividends over the vesting period. Option exercise prices are equal to the common stock fair market value on the date of grant. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted. The following summarizes the assumptions used in the models:
73


[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/10-K_page74_table0.json]
Lattice-based option valuation models, such as the binomial option pricing model, incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs. The risk-free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. government instrument over the contractual term of the equity instrument. Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on the Company’s stock and historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise timing and employee termination rates within the valuation model. The weighted-average dividend yield is based on historical information. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges presented result from separate groups of employees assumed to exhibit different behavior.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during
2014
,
2013
and
2012
was $
15.14
$10.06
$11.48
per share, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31,
115
million,
$108 million
$84 million
, respectively. As of December 31,
, there was $
13
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.4
years. Exercise of options during the years ended December 31,
resulted in cash receipts of $
148
million, $
206 million
$285 million
, respectively. The total fair value of vested stock option awards during the years ended December 31,
16
$16 million
$48 million
, respectively.
As of December 31,
16 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual life of
