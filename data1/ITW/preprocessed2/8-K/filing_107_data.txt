Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 24, 2023
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2023 third quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, for comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefit of $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Also, for comparability, the Company excluded the discrete tax benefits of $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $51 million in the second quarter of 2022 from net income and the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 excluding the net impact of gains from two divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other annual periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

ITW Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results
•
Revenue of $4.0 billion, an increase of 0.5%
Operating income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 9%
Operating margin of 26.5%, an increase of 200 bps
GAAP EPS of $2.55, an increase of 9%
Narrowing full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $9.65 to $9.85 per share
GLENVIEW, IL., October 24, 2023
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its third quarter 2023 results.
“The strength and resilience of ITW’s proprietary business model and high-quality diversified portfolio once again drove strong operational execution and financial performance in the third quarter. Quarterly operating margin expanded 200 basis points year over year to 26.5 percent, free cash flow grew 40 percent, and GAAP EPS grew nine percent to $2.55,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Organic revenue growth was two percent on an equal days’ basis in the quarter. Looking ahead at the balance of the year, while we anticipate some impact from ongoing automotive industry labor actions on our Automotive OEM segment in the fourth quarter, the company remains well-positioned to deliver another strong year of differentiated overall performance in 2023.”
Third Quarter 2023 Results
Third quarter revenue of $4.0 billion increased 0.5 percent with organic revenue growth of 0.2 percent, as divestitures reduced revenue by 1.2 percent and foreign currency translation added 1.5 percent. On an equal days’ basis, organic growth was two percent. End customer and channel partner inventory reduction efforts associated with supply chain normalization reduced organic growth by an estimated 1 to 1.5 percent in the quarter.
GAAP EPS increased nine percent to $2.55 and the effective tax rate was 23.8 percent. Operating income grew nine percent to $1.1 billion. Operating margin of 26.5 percent expanded 200 basis points as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Operating cash flow was $982 million, and free cash flow was $856 million, an increase of 40 percent, with a conversion rate to net income of 111 percent. During the quarter, the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and raised its dividend seven percent to an annualized $5.60 per share.
2023 Guidance
ITW is narrowing the range of its full year GAAP EPS guidance from $9.55 to $9.95 per share to a range of $9.65 to $9.85 per share, which includes a $0.12 per share adjustment for the estimated fourth quarter impact of ongoing automotive industry labor actions. The company is projecting total revenue growth of one to two percent with organic growth of two to three percent based on current levels of demand exiting the third quarter, and the estimated fourth quarter impact of ongoing automotive industry labor actions. Combined divestitures and foreign currency translation are expected to reduce revenue by one percent. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 25 to 25.5 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points at the mid-point, with enterprise initiatives contributing more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is projected to be greater than 100 percent of net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares. The expected tax rate is in the range of 22.5 to 23.5 percent.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow to net income conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding global supply chain challenges, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, the impact of enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, statements regarding diluted income per share, restructuring expenses and related benefits, expected dividend payments, after-tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected access to liquidity sources, expected capital allocation, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions,


the impact of recent or potential acquisitions and/or divestitures, the potential impact of automotive industry labor actions, and the company’s 2023 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Such factors include those risk factors contained in ITW's Form 10-K for 2022 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
