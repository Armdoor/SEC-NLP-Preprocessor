Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 30, 2024
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company") announced its 2024 second quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure, along with free cash flow to net income conversion rate, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("After-tax ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. After-tax ROIC is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). After-tax ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company's ability to generate returns from cash invested in its operations and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate After-tax ROIC. The Company defines After-tax ROIC as operating income after taxes divided by average invested capital, which is annualized when presented in interim periods. Operating income after taxes is a non-GAAP measure consisting of net income before interest expense and other income (expense), on an after-tax basis, which are excluded as they do not represent returns generated by the Company's operations. For comparability, the Company also excluded the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 from net income and the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Total invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, other than cash and equivalents and outstanding debt which do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. The most comparable GAAP measure to operating income after taxes is net income. Calculations of net income to average invested capital and After-tax ROIC are included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company presented diluted net income per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023 excluding the discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2023. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure enhances investors' understanding of the Company's underlying financial performance and improves comparability with other periods. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to diluted net income per share is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

• Revenue of $4.0 billion, a decrease of 1% with flat organic growth
• Operating income of $1.05 billion, an increase of 4.5%
• Operating margin of 26.2%, an increase of 140 bps as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 bps

GLENVIEW, IL., July 30, 2024
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its second quarter 2024 results and updated guidance for full-year 2024.
“While the demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio, we delivered a solid quarter with strong operational execution and profitability,” said Christopher A. O’Herlihy, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our ability to overcome near-term macro challenges and expand our margin and profitability to record levels as evidenced by margin improvement of 140 basis points to 26.2 percent and EPS growth of more than five percent, is a direct result of the focused execution by our team of dedicated ITW professionals around the world.”
“Looking ahead, we are lowering the top-end of our full year GAAP EPS guidance to reflect current levels of demand partially offset by better margin performance. We remain focused on managing and investing for the long-term as we build above-market organic growth, fueled by customer-back innovation, into a core ITW strength,” O’Herlihy concluded.
Second Quarter 2024 Results
Second quarter revenue of $4.0 billion declined by 1.2 percent as organic growth declined 0.1 percent. Foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 1.2 percent and acquisitions added 0.1 percent.
GAAP EPS increased 2.4 percent to $2.54 and excluding a one-time tax item in 2023, EPS increased 5.4 percent. Operating income increased 4.5 percent to $1.05 billion, a second quarter record. Operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.2 percent, a second quarter record, as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Operating cash flow was $687 million, and free cash flow was $571 million with a conversion of 75 percent to net income. During the quarter, the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and the effective tax rate was 24.4 percent.
2024 Guidance
ITW is lowering the top-end of its full year GAAP EPS guidance range of $10.30 to $10.70 per share to a narrower range of $10.30 to $10.40 per share, an increase of six percent compared to the prior year at the midpoint. Based on current levels of demand and foreign currency exchange rates exiting the second quarter, the company is projecting revenue growth and organic growth to be approximately flat for 2024. ITW is raising its operating margin guidance from 26 to 27 percent to a narrower range of 26.5 to 27 percent, an increase of 165 bps at the midpoint with enterprise initiatives projected to contribute more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to exceed 100 percent of net income and the company plans to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its own shares. The projected effective tax rate remains unchanged in the range of 24 to 24.5 percent.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule. The estimated guidance of free cash flow to net income conversion rate is based on assumptions that are difficult to predict, and estimated guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a reconciliation of this forward-looking estimate to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate have been omitted due to the unreasonable efforts required in connection with such a reconciliation and the lack of reliable forward-looking cash flow information. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the potential significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.
Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding global supply chain challenges, expected impact of inflation including raw material inflation and rising interest rates, the impact of enterprise initiatives, future financial and operating performance, free cash flow and free cash flow to net income conversion rate, organic and total revenue, operating and incremental margin, price/cost impact, statements regarding diluted income per share, expected dividend payments, after-


tax return on invested capital, effective tax rates, exchange rates, expected timing and amount of share repurchases, end market economic and regulatory conditions, the impact of recent or potential acquisitions and/or divestitures, and the Company’s 2024 guidance. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include those that are detailed in ITW’s Form 10-K for 2023 and subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
