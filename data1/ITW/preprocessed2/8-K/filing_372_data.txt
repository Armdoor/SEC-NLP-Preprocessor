GLENVIEW, IL., May 5, 2020 -
Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first quarter 2020 results with GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.77 compared to $1.81 in the prior year period. First-quarter revenue of $3.2 billion declined 9.1 percent with organic revenue down 6.6 percent. Foreign currency translation and divestitures reduced revenues by 1.5 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. Operating margin was flat at 23.6 percent as Enterprise Initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Free cash flow was $554 million with a 98 percent conversion rate and after-tax return on invested capital was 27.0 percent.
ITW’s differentiated financial position includes a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand, essentially no short-term debt, and a revolving credit facility in place that could provide additional liquidity of up to $2.5 billion, if needed.
“While things are far from normal for any of us or our businesses at present, I am inspired and heartened by the teamwork, flexibility, ingenuity, and selflessness demonstrated by the ITW team in adapting to the very unusual and challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic,” said E. Scott Santi, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our ITW colleagues everywhere are going the extra mile to protect the health and support the well-being of each other and to continue to serve our customers with excellence. Around the world, many ITW manufacturing locations have been designated as essential, signifying the vital role the company plays in supporting customers and industries that are critical to the economic health of the markets and communities we serve.”
“It remains highly uncertain as to how long this global pandemic and related economic challenges will last or how quickly our customers and end markets will recover. However, I am confident that the strength and resilience of ITW’s powerful Business Model, our diversified, high-quality business portfolio, and our people put us in a position of strength to deal with whatever lies ahead. ITW will rise to the challenge, as we always have over the course of our 108-year history. Our strong financial position gives us the latitude to make strategic choices now to prepare for a range of recovery scenarios, and to come out the other side well-positioned to continue on our path to
ITW’s full-potential performance.”
