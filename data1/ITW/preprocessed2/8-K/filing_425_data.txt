Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 25, 2019
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2019
third
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the third quarter 2019 discrete tax benefit of $21 million from the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Additionally, the Company excluded the third quarter 2018 net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, and for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, IL., October 25, 2019
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its third-quarter 2019 results including GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.04 compared to $1.90 in the third quarter of 2018. Foreign currency had a $0.05 negative impact to earnings per share versus the prior year.
“While the demand environment continued to moderate across a broad cross section of our portfolio, we delivered another solid quarter with excellent operational execution,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our ability to overcome near-term macro challenges and deliver seven percent earnings per share growth, expand margins to 25 percent, and grow free cash flow by 12 percent is a direct result of our high quality business portfolio, the performance power of the ITW Business Model, and focused execution by our team of dedicated ITW professionals around the world,” Santi concluded.
Revenue of $3.5 billion was down 3.7 percent with unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 1.8 percent and a decline in organic revenue of 1.7 percent. The company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic growth by 60 basis points. The third quarter 2019 benefited from one extra shipping day versus the prior year. Adjusting for this impact, organic revenues declined 3.2 percent on an equal day basis versus a decline of 2.8 percent in the second quarter.
Operating margin was 25.0 percent as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points. Price/cost was favorable 20 basis points. Free Cash Flow was $830 million, an increase of 12 percent versus the prior year and 126 percent of net income. In the quarter, the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares and raised its dividend seven percent to an annualized $4.28 per share.
After-tax return on invested capital was 29.2 percent, an improvement of 120 basis points. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.6 percent, and benefited from a $21 million or $0.07 EPS adjustment to the company’s estimated U.S. federal tax liability for tax year 2018.
2019 Full-Year Guidance
The company is maintaining its full-year GAAP EPS guidance of $7.55 to $7.85 per share, as compared to GAAP EPS of $7.60 in 2018. Year-over-year headwinds from foreign currency translation impact and higher restructuring expenses are expected to impact 2019 EPS by approximately $0.30. The company expects organic revenue down one to three percent, and operating margin of approximately 24 percent. Free cash flow is expected to exceed 100 percent of net income and the company is on pace to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its shares.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.

This earnings release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding diluted earnings per share, foreign exchange rates, total and organic revenue growth, operating margin, economic and regulatory conditions in various geographic regions, price/cost impact, restructuring expenses, free cash flow, effective tax rate, after-tax return on invested capital, and timing and amount of share repurchases.
