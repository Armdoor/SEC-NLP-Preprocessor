Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 26, 2019
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2019
second
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the first quarter 2018 discrete tax benefit of $14 million related to foreign tax credits from the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The Company also excluded the third quarter net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
ITW Reports Second Quarter 2019 Results
GLENVIEW, IL., July 26, 2019
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its second-quarter 2019 results including GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.91 compared to $1.97 in the second quarter of 2018. Revenue of $3.6 billion was down 5.8 percent with organic revenue down 2.8 percent and unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 2.7 percent. Operating margin was 24.1 percent.
“In the second quarter, we experienced a deceleration in demand across our portfolio relative to the demand levels we were seeing exiting the first quarter. On a sequential basis, second quarter organic revenue declined approximately two percentage points versus first quarter run rates,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
“In this more challenging demand environment, the ITW team executed well on the elements within our own control and delivered solid financial results. Operating margin improved year-over-year to 24.4 percent, excluding higher restructuring impact of 30 basis points, as enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points. The combination of unfavorable foreign currency translation, higher restructuring expenses and a small loss on two divestitures reduced EPS by $0.09 year-over-year. Excluding these three items, EPS would have increased two percent to $2.00. Free cash flow increased 14 percent year-on-year.”
“We are updating our full year guidance to reflect current levels of demand. All other assumptions remain essentially unchanged. We continue to expect a stronger second half on a relative basis, as known headwinds from foreign currency and higher restructuring expenses dissipate. We expect continued strong contributions from enterprise initiatives, positive price/cost margin dynamics, and strong free cash flow as we progress through the balance of the year. While we will be prudent in making appropriate adjustments due to the near-term demand environment, we remain focused on managing and investing to maximize ITW’s performance over the long term. The highly differentiated nature of ITW’s core competitive advantages and the strength and resilience of our proprietary business model and diversified portfolio position us well for strong financial performance across a wide range of economic scenarios,” Santi concluded.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was down 5.8 percent with organic revenue down 2.8 percent, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 2.7 percent, and divestiture impact of 0.3 percent. As expected, the company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic growth by 70 basis points.
Operating margin was 24.1 percent. Excluding 30 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from higher year-over-year restructuring expenses, operating margin improved 10 basis points to 24.4 percent. Free Cash Flow increased 14 percent and the company repurchased $375 million of its own shares. After-tax return on invested capital was 28.6 percent.
2019 Full-Year Guidance
Current levels of demand, adjusted for normal seasonality, project full year organic revenue to be down one to three percent. As a result, the company is updating its full year GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $7.55 to $7.85, which includes approximately $0.25 of headwind from foreign currency translation and higher restructuring expenses. Operating margin is forecast to be flat to up 50 basis points, largely due to strong contributions from enterprise initiatives of 100 basis points, partially offset by 25 basis points of higher restructuring expenses. Free cash flow is expected to be above 100 percent of net income, and the company is on pace to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of its shares. The effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 24 to 25 percent.

This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.
