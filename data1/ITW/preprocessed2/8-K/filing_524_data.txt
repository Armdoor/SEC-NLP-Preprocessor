Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
July 23, 2018
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2018
second
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents certain financial measures for 2017 excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. For comparability, the Company excluded the confidential legal settlement from the calculation of ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations. Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., July 23, 2018
- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported second quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.97 per share, a 17 percent increase compared to the year ago period. As previously disclosed, the company recorded an EPS benefit of $0.03 per share related to a legal settlement in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding this item, earnings per share increased 19 percent. In addition, currency had a $0.03 negative impact to earnings per share versus guidance provided for the second quarter.
“ITW delivered another strong quarter with good growth momentum and excellent operational execution,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The company’s ability to overcome near-term inflationary and currency challenges and generate four percent organic revenue growth, core operating earnings growth of nine percent, core EPS growth of 19 percent, and continue to expand margins is a direct result of the strength and resilience of the ITW Business Model and the dedicated team of ITW professionals around the world who leverage it to serve our customers and execute our strategy with excellence each and every day.”
Revenue was up seven percent with four percent organic growth. Operating income was $932 million in the quarter, an increase of seven percent, and operating margin was 24.3 percent, an increase of 10 basis points. Excluding the second quarter 2017 legal settlement, operating income was up nine percent and operating margin increased 50 basis points. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting 70 basis points of unfavorable price/cost impact. Year-to-date on a dollar-for-dollar basis, pricing actions essentially offset the impact of raw material cost inflation.
All seven of the company’s business segments delivered positive year on year organic revenue growth, led by Welding with 13 percent. Organic growth of four percent was driven by five percent growth in North America.
After-tax return on invested capital was 28.7 percent, an improvement of 440 basis points, of which 400 basis points resulted from new U.S tax rules and regulations.
In the second quarter, Free Cash Flow was $533 million, an increase of 38 percent. The company repurchased $500 million of its own shares.
2018 Guidance
Based on current foreign exchange rates, second half earnings per share are projected to have a $0.12 negative currency impact versus prior guidance. ITW adjusted 2018 full-year EPS guidance to reflect this impact, and expects earnings in a range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share, or 15 percent growth at the midpoint. The company also revised its outlook for operating margin to a range of 24 to 25 percent reflecting price/cost related margin dilution. The company continues to expect to recover the impact of raw material cost increases through price actions on a dollar for dollar basis for the full year and as a result, expects the full year price/cost impact on the company’s earnings per share to be neutral (as it was in the first half of 2018). The company continues to expect organic growth of three to four percent, free cash flow at or above 100 percent of net income, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25 percent for the year. The company now expects to repurchase $1.5 billion of its own shares in 2018.
For the third quarter 2018, the company expects earnings to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share, with revenue up two to three percent and organic growth of three to four percent. As a reminder, prior year third quarter GAAP EPS of $1.85 included a $0.14 benefit from a legal settlement. Excluding this item, adjusted EPS was $1.71 per share.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.
