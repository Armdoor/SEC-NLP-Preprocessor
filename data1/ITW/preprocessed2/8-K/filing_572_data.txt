Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
January 24, 2018
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2017
fourth quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents certain financial measures excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" in the fourth quarter of 2017
and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes
and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’
understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results
and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., January 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results.
“The ITW team delivered another year of strong execution and performance in 2017,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2017, excluding one-time tax and legal items, we grew EPS 16%, improved operating margin by 120 basis points to an all-time high of 23.7% and increased after-tax return on invested capital 230 basis points to a record 24.4%.”
“We also continued to make meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth. Our 2017 organic growth rate of 3% was up almost 2 percentage points versus 2016. In addition, our Q4 organic growth rate of 4% gives us good momentum going into 2018.”
“Overall, these results demonstrate continued progress in our efforts to position ITW to generate consistent differentiated performance on a sustained basis,” Santi added. “Through the combination of ITW’s high quality business portfolio and our ongoing focus on leveraging ITW’s powerful business model to full potential, we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond.”
Fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% to $3.6 billion as organic revenue increased 4% and foreign currency translation increased revenue by 3%. GAAP EPS of $(0.22) includes a one-time $658 million charge associated with the passage of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” The charge encompasses several elements, including a repatriation tax on accumulated overseas earnings and a benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding this one-time item, EPS increased 17% to $1.70. Operating margin was 23.4%, an increase of 160 basis points, with enterprise initiatives contributing 140 basis points of margin improvement.
Organic revenue growth was positive in six of seven segments led by Test & Measurement and Electronics (+9%), Welding (+6%) and Specialty Products (+5%).
Full-year 2017 revenue increased 5% to $14.3 billion with organic growth of 3%. GAAP EPS of $4.86 includes the above-mentioned unfavorable tax impact and a $0.17 benefit from a previously disclosed favorable legal item. Excluding these one-time items, EPS was $6.59, an increase of 16% year-on-year. Operating margin was 24.4% and includes a 70 basis point benefit from the legal item. Excluding this item, operating margin was 23.7%, an increase of 120 basis points.
Full-Year and First Quarter 2018 Guidance
ITW is raising its 2018 full-year guidance by $0.40 at the midpoint to reflect the benefits of a reduction in the tax rate to an estimated range of 25 to 26% and current foreign exchange rates. The company expects 2018 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.65 per share with organic growth of 3 to 4%.


The company forecasts first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share with organic growth of 3 to 4%.
Subject to formal Board approval, ITW expects to accelerate previously announced plans to increase its dividend pay-out ratio from 43% to approximately 50% of Free Cash Flow on a run rate basis in August of 2018.
Non-GAAP Measures
This earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached supplemental reconciliation schedule.
