Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
October 23, 2017
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2017
third
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., Oct. 23, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its third-quarter 2017 results.
Third-quarter revenue grew 4% to $3.6 billion as organic revenue and foreign currency translation each increased revenue by 2% in the quarter. GAAP EPS of $1.85 includes a $0.14 benefit from a previously disclosed favorable legal settlement. Excluding this item, EPS increased 14% to $1.71. Operating margin was 26.6% and includes a 220 basis point benefit from the settlement. Excluding this item, operating margin was 24.4%, an increase of 130 basis points, with enterprise initiatives contributing 110 basis points of margin improvement.
“In the third quarter, the ITW team continued to execute at a high level and, as a result, delivered another quarter of strong financial results,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “I continue to be very pleased with our progress in positioning the company to leverage ITW’s differentiated business model and high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver consistent top tier performance.”
Organic revenue growth was positive in six of seven segments led by Specialty Products (+5%), Welding (+4%) and Construction (+4%).
As previously disclosed, the company entered into a confidential legal settlement in 2017, resulting in a favorable pre-tax impact of $80 million on the third quarter 2017 results. The following schedule illustrates the impact of this item on the company’s reported third quarter 2017 financial performance.
