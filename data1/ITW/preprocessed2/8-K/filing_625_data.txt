Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
April 24, 2017
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2017
first
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., April, 24 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its first-quarter 2017 results.
First-quarter GAAP earnings were $1.54 per share, an increase of 19% versus the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, EPS grew 21% year-on-year. Revenue grew 6.0% to $3.5 billion. Organic revenue increased 3.5% while the 2016 acquisition of Engineered Fasteners & Components (EF&C) added 3.8% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 1.3%.
“Our record results in the first quarter reflect strong execution across the company and further progress in our efforts to leverage ITW’s highly differentiated and proprietary business model to drive solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are off to a strong start in 2017 and the company is well-positioned to deliver continued progress and differentiated performance through the balance of 2017 and beyond.”
Operating income was $809 million, an increase of 12%, and operating margin for the quarter was 23.3%, an increase of 120 basis points. Excluding the margin impact from the 2016 acquisition of EF&C, operating margin was 23.8%, an increase of 170 basis points year-on-year with 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from Enterprise Initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital was 23.8%, an improvement of 260 basis points. First-quarter net income was $536 million.
Organic revenue growth was positive in six of seven segments: 9% in Automotive OEM, 6% in Test & Measurement/Electronics, 3% in Construction Products, 2% in Food Equipment and Polymers & Fluids and 1% in Specialty Products. Welding was flat.
Effective January 1, 2017 the company adopted FASB guidance that requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense rather than equity. The first-quarter effective tax rate was 28.3%, in line with company expectations.
Full-Year and Second Quarter 2017 Guidance
As a result of the company’s strong Q1 results, ITW is raising its 2017 full-year guidance. The company now expects earnings to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40 per share, up from prior guidance of $6.00 to $6.20 per share, with organic growth of 2 to 4%, up from 1.5 to 3.5%. ITW expects operating margin to exceed 23.5% and free cash flow to exceed 100% of net income. The company now expects an effective tax rate of approximately 29%, down from prior guidance of 29 to 30%, resulting in an EPS benefit of $0.04 per share.
For the second quarter 2017, the company expects earnings to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share with organic growth of 2 to 4%.
