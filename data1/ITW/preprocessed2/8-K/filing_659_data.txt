Item 8.01 Other Events.
(a) Amended Forms of Grant under 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Amended forms of grant for stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance share units, or PSUs, and the Performance Cash grants, or P Cash, to be issued pursuant to the Illinois Tool Works Inc. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are included as exhibits to this report.
(b) Updated Description of Capital Stock
The Company is updating the description of its capital stock that was contained in the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2015. To the extent the following description is inconsistent with prior filings, it modifies and supersedes those filings:
Description of Capital Stock
The following description of the Company’s capital stock is intended as a summary only. This description is based upon, and is qualified by reference to, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and the applicable provisions of Delaware corporation law.
General
As of January 31, 2017, the authorized capital stock of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”) consists of 700,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 300,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value. As of January 31, 2017, there were 346,550,685 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. No preferred stock is issued and outstanding.
Common Stock
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record, in person or by proxy, at all meetings of the stockholders and on all propositions presented to such meetings (other than the election of any directors who may be elected by vote of the preferred stock voting as a class). The common stock does not entitle holders to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights.
All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Dividends may be paid on the common stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor. Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of ITW, its assets remaining, after provision for payment of creditors and holders of any preferred stock, are distributable pro rata among holders of its common stock.
The common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ITW.” The transfer agent and registrar of the common stock is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., Philadelphia, PA.
Preferred Stock
ITW’s preferred stock is issuable in series. The preferred stock is senior to the common stock, both as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets. The designation, preferences and rights of each series may be established by the Board of Directors, including voting rights, dividends, redemption features, payments on liquidation and sinking fund provisions, if any. The preferred stock may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital or to finance acquisitions. The preferred stock also could be issued to persons friendly to current management with terms that could render more difficult or discourage attempts to gain control of ITW by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise and thereby protect the continuity of current management. The preferred stock also could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of ITW.
Special Charter and By-law Provisions
ITW’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, as amended and restated, contain provisions that could render more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or attempt to gain control of the Board of Directors. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prohibits stockholder action by written consent. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws permit only the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors, whether created by an increase in the number of directors or otherwise, and permit special meetings of stockholders to be called by the chairman, the president or a majority of the Board of Directors, or, subject to procedural requirements set forth in the By‑laws, by stockholders that own at least 20% of the


Company’s outstanding common stock. The By-laws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Under the By-laws, up to 20 stockholders owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock for at least 3 years may include nominations in the Company’s proxy materials for up to the greater of 25% of the Board of Directors or 2 directors, provided the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-laws. The By-laws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder’s notice.

Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/EX-99.1_page2_table5.json]

[Table stored in: /Users/akshitsanoria/Desktop/PythonP/json_tables/EX-99.1_page3_table0.json]
(iv) any other method determined by the Company.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares subject to the exercised option, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.


You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services (“Fidelity”) or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Fidelity and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, request access to Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant options or other equity awards to you or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

APPENDIX B
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the option agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your option if you reside and/or work in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the option agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the options were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your option vests, you exercise your option, or you sell shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the option was granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
AUSTRALIA
Breach of Law
. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or the option agreement, you will not be entitled to, and shall not claim any benefit (including without limitation a legal right) under the Plan if the provision of such benefit would give rise to a breach of Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), any other provision of that Act, or any other applicable statute, rule or regulation which limits or restricts the giving of such benefits. Further, the Employer is under no obligation to seek or obtain the approval of its shareholders in a general meeting for the purpose of overcoming any such limitation or restriction.


Tax Information.
The Plan is a plan to which Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (the “Act”) applies (subject to the conditions in that Act).
Notifications
Securities Law Information
. You understand that if you acquire shares upon exercise of the
option and subsequently offer the shares for sale to a person or entity resident in Australia, the
offer may be subject to disclosure requirements under Australian law. You are advised to
obtain legal advice regarding any applicable disclosure requirements prior to making any such
offer.
GERMANY
Exchange Control Information
. Cross-border payments in excess of €12,500 must be reported electronically monthly to the Germany Federal Bank. In the event that you make or receive a payment in excess of this amount, you are responsible for obtaining the appropriate form from the remitting bank and complying with applicable reporting requirements.
SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation
. By accepting the option, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the grant of the options, your termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement (including for the reasons listed below) will automatically result in the forfeiture of any options that have not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the option agreement, the option will be forfeited without entitlement to the underlying shares or to any amount as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including but not limited to: resignation, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause; disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); individual or collective layoff on objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause; material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute; relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute; Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute; unilateral withdrawal by the Employer; and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant the option under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the option agreement. Consequently, you understand that the option is granted on the assumption and condition that the option and the shares underlying the option shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the option would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you


acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of options shall be null and void.
Notifications
Securities Law Information
. The option described in the option agreement and Appendix A and B do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The option agreement (including Appendix A and B) has not been nor will it be registered with the
Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores
, and it does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information
. Spanish residents must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of stock in a foreign company (including shares acquired under the Plan) to the Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, for statistical purposes. Generally, the declaration must be made in January for shares acquired or sold during (or owned as of December 31 of) the prior year; however, if the value of shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or the Spanish resident holds 10% or more of the shares capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect, the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (e.g., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.

Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:

(iv) any other method determined by the Company.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares subject to the vested RSU, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

(ii) the grant of the RSU is exceptional, discretionary, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of RSUs, or benefits in lieu of RSUs, even if RSUs have been granted in the past;
(iii) all decisions with respect to future RSU grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(iv) your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further employment with the Employer and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate your employment or service relationship (if any) at any time;
(v) you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(vi) the RSU and the shares subject to the RSU, and the income from and value of same, are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Employer, and are outside the scope of your employment or service contract, if any;
(vii) the RSU and the shares subject to the RSU, and the income from and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

(xi) the future value of the underlying shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(xii) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSU resulting from termination of your employment or other service relationship by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever, and whether or not in breach of local labor laws and whether or not later found to be invalid), and in consideration of the grant of the RSU to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company or the Employer and you irrevocably waive your ability, if any, to


bring any such claim, and release the Company and the Employer from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims;
(xiii) unless otherwise provided in the RSU agreement, in the event of termination of your employment or other service relationship (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not in breach of local labor laws and whether or not later found to be invalid), your right to vest in the RSU under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed or rendering services and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (

(b) No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares. You should consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
(c)
Data Privacy. You hereby voluntarily consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this RSU agreement and any other RSU grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Employer, the Company and its other Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.
You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services (“Fidelity”) or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Fidelity and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

You understand that you may, at any time, request access to Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing


the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant the RSUs or other equity awards to you or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

(e) Retirement. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the RSU agreement, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in your jurisdiction that would likely result in the favorable treatment applicable to the RSU pursuant to paragraph (e) being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Company will not apply the favorable treatment at the time of your retirement, and the RSU will be treated as set forth in paragraph (f) of the RSU agreement.
(f) Waiver. You acknowledge that a waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this RSU agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this RSU agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or another Participant.
(g) Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws. You acknowledge that, you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States, which may affect your ability to acquire or sell shares or rights to shares (
e.g
., RSU) under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the laws of applicable jurisdictions) regarding the Company. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
(h) Foreign Asset/Account Reporting; Exchange Controls. Your country may have certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements and/or exchange controls which may affect your ability to acquire or hold shares under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside your country. You may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in your country. You also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of your participation in the Plan to your country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be compliant with such regulations, and you should consult your personal legal advisor for any details.


APPENDIX B
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the RSU agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your RSUs if you reside and/or work in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the RSU agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the RSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your RSU vests or you sell shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the RSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:

Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your PSUs if you reside and/or work in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the PSU agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the PSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your PSU vests or you sell shares acquired under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the PSUs were granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.


AUSTRALIA
Terms and Conditions
Breach of Law. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or the PSU agreement, you will not be entitled to, and shall not claim any benefit (including without limitation a legal right) under the Plan if the provision of such benefit would give rise to a breach of Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), any other provision of that Act, or any other applicable statute, rule or regulation which limits or restricts the giving of such benefits. Further, the Employer is under no obligation to seek or obtain the approval of its shareholders in a general meeting for the purpose of overcoming any such limitation or restriction.
Tax Information.
The Plan is a plan to which Subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (the “Act”) applies (subject to the conditions in that Act).
Notifications
Securities Law Information. The PSU grant is intended to comply with the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001, ASIC Regulatory Guide 49 and ASIC Class Order 14/1000. Additional details are set forth in the Offer Document for the Offer of Restricted Stock Units to Australian Resident Employees, the Plan and the PSU agreement. By accepting the PSU grant, you acknowledge and confirm that you have received these documents.
Exchange Control Information. Exchange control reporting is required for cash transactions exceeding A$10,000 and international fund transfers. The Australian bank assisting with the transaction will file the report. If there is no Australian bank involved in the transfer, you will be required to file the report.
CHINA
Settlement of PSU. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of the PSU agreement, due to legal restrictions in China, the PSU will be paid in cash at vesting and not in shares. You will receive a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the vesting date multiplied by the number of vested PSU. The cash payment will be made by the Employer and will be paid to you in local currency through your local payroll. The cash payment will be subject to all applicable tax withholding and reporting. To convert the payment amount from US dollars into local currency, the Company will use an exchange rate determined pursuant to the Company’s financial policies in effect on the payment date. Depending on the development of exchange control or other applicable laws in China, the Company, at its discretion, may determine that other payment methods may be used.
Exchange Control Requirements. You agree to comply with any requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange control requirements in China.
GERMANY
Exchange Control Information. Cross-border payments in excess of €12,500 must be reported electronically monthly to the Germany Federal Bank. In the event that you make or receive a payment in excess of this amount, you are responsible for obtaining the appropriate form from the remitting bank and complying with applicable reporting requirements.


SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation. By accepting the PSU, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the grant of the PSU, your termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement (including for the reasons listed below) will automatically result in the forfeiture of any PSU that has not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the PSU agreement, the PSU will be forfeited without entitlement to the underlying shares or to any amount as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including, but not limited to: resignation, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (
i.e
., subject to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective layoff on objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute, Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by the Employer, and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant the PSU under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the PSU agreement. Consequently, you understand that the PSU is granted on the assumption and condition that the PSU and the shares underlying the PSU shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the PSU would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of PSU shall be null and void.
Notifications
Securities Law Information. The PSU described in the PSU agreement and Appendices A and B do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The PSU agreement (including Appendices A and B) has not been nor will it be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and it does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information. Spanish residents must declare the acquisition, ownership and disposition of stock in a foreign company (including shares acquired under the Plan) to the Dirección General de Comercio e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, for statistical purposes. Generally, the declaration must be made in January for shares acquired or sold during (or owned as of December 31 of) the prior year; however, if the value of shares acquired or sold exceeds €1,502,530 (or the Spanish resident holds 10% or more of the shares capital of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Company’s board of directors), the declaration must be filed within one (1) month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.


In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect, the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis (by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (
e.g
., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.
UNITED KINGDOM
Terms and Conditions
Tax and National Insurance Contributions Acknowledgment. The following provisions supplement paragraph (k) of the PSU agreement:
Without limitation to paragraph (k), you hereby agree that you are liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenant to pay all such Tax-Related Items, as and when requested by the Company, the Employer or by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). You also hereby agree to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and the Employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold on your behalf or have paid or will pay to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority).

You understand that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number, passport or other identification number (e.g., resident registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all P CASH grants and any entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.
You understand that Data will be transferred to Fidelity Stock Plan Services (“Fidelity”) or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Fidelity and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that you may, at any time, request access to Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant P CASH or equity awards to you or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

APPENDIX B
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan and/or the P CASH agreement (including Appendix A).
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix B includes special terms and conditions applicable to your P CASH grant if you reside and/or work in any of the countries covered by this Appendix B. These terms and conditions are in addition to, or if so indicated, in place of, the terms and conditions set forth in the P CASH agreement (including Appendix A).
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the P CASH award was granted or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Company shall have the sole discretion to determine to what extent the terms and conditions shall apply to you under these circumstances.
Notifications
This Appendix B also includes notifications relating to exchange control and other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the exchange control, securities, and other laws in effect in the countries to which this Appendix B refers as of January 2017. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the notifications herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participating in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time your P CASH grant vests or you receive cash under the Plan.
In addition, the notifications are general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transferred or transfer residency or employment after the P CASH grant is made or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
AUSTRALIA
There are no country-specific provisions.
CHINA
Settlement of P CASH Grant. Upon vesting of this P CASH grant, payment of the cash award will be made by the Employer and will be paid to you in local currency through your local payroll. The cash payment will be subject to all applicable tax withholding and reporting. To convert the payment amount from US dollars into local currency, the Company will use an exchange rate determined pursuant to the Company’s financial policies in effect on the payment date. Depending on the development of exchange control or other applicable laws in China, the Company, at its discretion, may determine that other payment methods may be used.


Exchange Control Requirements. You agree to comply with any requirements that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange control requirements in China.
GERMANY
Notifications
Exchange Control Information
. Cross-border payments in excess of €12,500 must be reported electronically monthly to the Germany Federal Bank. In the event that you make or receive a payment in excess of this amount, you are responsible for obtaining the appropriate form from the remitting bank and complying with applicable reporting requirements.
SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
No Entitlement for Claims or Compensation
. By accepting the P CASH grant, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan document.
You understand and agree that, as a condition of the P CASH grant, your termination of employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement (including for the reasons listed below) will automatically result in the forfeiture of any P CASH grants that were not vested on the date of your termination.
In particular, you understand and agree that, unless otherwise provided in the P CASH agreement, the P CASH grant will be forfeited without entitlement to any cash payment as indemnification in the event of a termination of your employment prior to vesting by reason of, including, but not limited to: resignation, disciplinary dismissal adjudged to be with cause, disciplinary dismissal adjudged or recognized to be without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”), individual or collective layoff on objective grounds, whether adjudged to be with cause or adjudged or recognized to be without cause, material modification of the terms of employment under Article 41 of the Workers’ Statute, relocation under Article 40 of the Workers’ Statute, Article 50 of the Workers’ Statute, unilateral withdrawal by the Employer, and under Article 10.3 of Royal Decree 1382/1985.
Furthermore, you understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant P CASH awards under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company Group. The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the P CASH agreement. Consequently, you understand that the P CASH awards are granted on the assumption and condition that the P CASH grant and the cash award subject to the P CASH grant shall not become a part of any employment or service contract and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. In addition, you understand that the P CASH award would not be granted to you but for the assumptions and conditions referred to above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that, should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then any award of P CASH shall be null and void.
In addition, Spanish residents are required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), any foreign instruments (including shares acquired under the Plan), and any transactions with non-Spanish residents (including any payments of cash or shares made to a Spanish resident pursuant to the Plan) if the balances in such accounts together with the value of such instruments as of December 31, or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents during the prior or current year, exceed €1,000,000. Once the €1,000,000 threshold has been surpassed in either respect, the Spanish resident generally will be required to report all foreign accounts, foreign instruments and transactions with non-Spanish residents, even if the relevant threshold has not been crossed for an individual item. Generally, the resident only will be required to report on an annual basis


(by January 20 of each year); however, if the balances in the Spanish resident’s foreign accounts together with the value of his or her foreign instruments or the volume of transactions with non-Spanish residents exceed €100,000,000, more frequent reporting will be required. If neither the total balances nor total transactions with non-residents during the relevant period exceeds €50,000, a summarized form declaration may be used.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Spanish residents must report assets or rights deposited or held outside of Spain (e.g., cash or shares held in a bank or brokerage account) to the Spanish tax authorities on their annual tax return. This reporting obligation is based on the value of those rights and assets as of December 31 and has a threshold of €50,000 per type of asset (bank account, shares, real estate, etc.). After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will apply for subsequent years only if the value of any previously reported asset or right increases by more than €20,000 or if ownership of such asset or right is transferred or relinquished during the year.
