Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
January 27, 2016
, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its
2015
fourth
quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. The Company’s presentation from the
quarter conference call held on
is furnished as Exhibit 99.2.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
The Company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("adjusted ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's net investment in the former Industrial Packaging segment and the equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of adjusted ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

GLENVIEW, Ill., January 27, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported fourth quarter 2015 diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.23, a 4 percent increase compared to the year-ago period. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 20.7 percent and organic revenue declined 0.6 percent. The company’s ongoing Product Line Simplification (PLS) activities reduced organic growth by 1 percentage-point.
"We are pleased with ITW’s strong performance in the quarter and for the year,” said E. Scott Santi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In the quarter, the company continued to deliver meaningful improvement in our EPS, operating margin, and return on invested capital metrics, and demand across our business portfolio held steady versus the third quarter. While demand for industrial equipment remains sluggish, we have seen stable underlying demand trends in both Welding and Test & Measurement/Electronics over the past two quarters.
“For full-year 2015, ITW grew EPS 10 percent, expanded operating margin by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4 percent, improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record of 20.4 percent, and returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2015, the company made meaningful progress on the organic growth component of our Enterprise Strategy as evidenced by 60 percent of the company’s revenues achieving “ready to grow” status and 45 percent growing at 6 percent organically. In the current economic environment and over the long-term, ITW’s unique business model and the execution of our Enterprise Strategy have us well-positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance,” Santi concluded.

Capital Allocation Update
On January 25, 2016, ITW announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire the Engineered Fasteners and Components (EF&C) business, a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and interior technical components to the automotive OEM market, from ZF TRW for approximately $450 million. Headquartered in Germany, EF&C operates 13 manufacturing facilities globally and employs approximately 3,500 people. EF&C had revenues of approximately $470 million in 2015. ITW plans to fund a majority of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash. The company expects the acquisition to be slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months and to generate long-term return on invested capital at or above the


company’s 20-plus percent target. Pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016.
In January 2016, ITW tax-efficiently accessed $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash. As a result, the company is raising its 2016 share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion.
2016 Guidance
The company is reaffirming its 2016 full-year EPS guidance of $5.35 to $5.55, which is a year-over-year increase of 6 percent at the midpoint. Organic revenue for the year is projected to be up 1 to 3 percent, which is in-line with current demand levels. The organic growth forecast includes approximately 90 basis points of impact from the company’s ongoing PLS activities. Operating margin is projected to be approximately 22.5 percent, an increase of more than 100 basis points year-over-year. ITW’s Enterprise Initiatives are expected to improve operating margin by 100 basis points, independent of volume growth.
For the first quarter 2016, the company expects EPS to be in a range of $1.20 to $1.30 and operating margin to be approximately 21.5 percent. Organic revenue is forecast to be flat to up 2 percent.
