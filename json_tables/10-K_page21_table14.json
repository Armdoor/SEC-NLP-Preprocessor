    "Operating margin of 19.9% increased 210 basis points primarily due to the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives related to business structure simplification and strategic sourcing that contributed 120 basis points and positive operating leverage of 60 basis points. Lower restructuring expenses of 20 basis points, favorable price/cost of 10 basis points and lower operating expenses also contributed to the increase in operating margin. Operating expenses in 2014 included the impact of lower employee benefit expenses, offset by costs related to continued investment in the business."
