    "Operating margin of 24.4% increased 190 basis points. Excluding the 70 basis points of favorability from the confidential legal settlement, operating margin of 23.7% increased 120 basis points primarily driven by the benefits of the Company's enterprise initiatives of 120 basis points. In addition, positive operating leverage of 70 basis points was offset by unfavorable price/cost of 40 basis points and the dilutive impact of 30 basis points from the EF&C acquisition."
