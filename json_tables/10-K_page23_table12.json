    "Operating margin of 22.5% increased 110 basis points. The primary driver of the operating margin improvement was 130 basis points from the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives. Positive operating leverage of 30 basis points and favorable price/cost of 10 basis points were partially offset by the dilutive impact of 30 basis points from the EF&C acquisition and additional investment in the business."
