    "Worldwide electronics organic revenue increased 1.2% primarily due to a 2.0% increase in the other electronics businesses, which was driven by growth in the contamination control businesses, resulting primarily from increased demand across all major regions, the pressure sensitive adhesives businesses, primarily due to higher market demand in Europe, and the static control businesses, primarily due to increased sales to the industrial end market in Asia and North America. Organic revenue for the electronic assembly businesses declined 0.7% but showed improvement in the second half of the year."
