    "In August 2014, the Company entered into a new accelerated share repurchase arrangement (\u201cASR\u201d) to purchase up to $9.0 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $9.0 billion, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares during the ASR\u2019s purchase period, which will end in or before February 2015. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during that period. During the fourth quarter of 2014, 59.9 million shares were delivered and retired under the ASR, and the final number of shares to be delivered will be determined at the conclusion of the purchase period.",
