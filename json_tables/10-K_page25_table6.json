    "Operating margin of 22.8% decreased 130 basis points primarily driven by the dilutive impact of 120 basis points from the EF&C acquisition, unfavorable price/cost of 120 basis points and higher restructuring expenses, partially offset by positive operating leverage of 60 basis points and the net benefits from the Company's enterprise initiatives and cost management of 90 basis points."
