    "Organic revenue grew 3.2% as equipment grew 6.5%, partially offset by a decrease of 1.0% in consumables. Organic revenue grew primarily due to increased demand in the industrial end markets related to heavy equipment for agriculture, infrastructure and mining and in the commercial end markets related to construction, light fabrication and farm and ranch customers."
