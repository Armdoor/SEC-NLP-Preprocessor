    "Organic revenue for the automotive aftermarket businesses increased 2.1% primarily driven by an increase in car care and tire repair in North America. Organic revenue for the polymers businesses increased 1.4% primarily driven by an increase in South America and a modest increase in the European wind energy business, partially offset by a decline in North America. Organic revenue for the fluids businesses was flat as growth in South America was offset by a decline in the industrial maintenance, repair, and operations end markets in North America."
