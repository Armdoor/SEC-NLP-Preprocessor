    "Other income (expense) was income of$36 millionin2017,$81 millionin2016and$78 millionin2015. The income in 2017 is lower than the previous year primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and a $54 million pre-tax gain recorded in 2016 resulting from a $167 million dividend distribution from Wilsonart that exceeded the equity investment balance, partially offset by $30 million of pre-tax losses in 2016 related to the disposals of businesses and the disposal of a partnership investment. The income in 2015 included a $15 million gain on the sale of a business."
