    "Resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws, which may vary depending on the province. Apple Inc. is not a reporting issuer in any province or territory of Canada. Unless permitted under applicable Canadian securities laws, holders of the Notes must not trade the Notes before the date that is the later of four months and a day after (i) August [\u25cf], 2017 and (ii) the date the Issuer becomes a reporting issuer in Canada. Prospective purchasers should consult their own independent legal advisors with respect to such restrictions. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which no established trading market exists.
