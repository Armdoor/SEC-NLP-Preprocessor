    "I express no opinion herein as to the legality, validity, binding nature or enforceability (whether in accordance with its terms or otherwise) of any provision in any Loan Document (i) insofar as it provides for the payment or reimbursement of costs and expenses or indemnification for claims, losses or liabilities in excess of a reasonable amount determined by a court or other tribunal; (ii) to the extent it purports to provide for indemnification of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in litigation regardless of whether the indemnified party prevails in such litigation; (iii) to the extent that it purports to permit the acceleration of obligations upon the happening of an immaterial breach of any provision of any Loan Document; (iv) which provides for the payment of any charge or amount which may be determined by a court or other tribunal to constitute a penalty, forfeiture or interest on interest; or (v) which limits jurisdiction of any courts or establishes any exclusive venue or evidentiary standards or purports to waive the right to a jury trial."
