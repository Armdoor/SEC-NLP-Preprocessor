    "The Company shall credit to a bookkeeping account maintained on your behalf an amount equal to any cash dividends you would have received, if the Shares subject to the RSU between the Grant Date and the Vesting Date had been issued and outstanding. The amount credited to the bookkeeping account shall be credited as additional RSUs which shall be paid to you upon vesting of the RSU. Except as provided herein, you shall have no voting, dividend or subscription rights except with respect to the Shares which have been issued to you following the vesting of your RSUs. Your rights under this RSU agreement may not be assigned or transferred other than as permitted by the Plan."
