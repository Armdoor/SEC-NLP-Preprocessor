    "(d)",
    "If you incur a Retirement prior to the Vesting Date, and your RSU was granted within a year prior to your Retirement, then 25% of your RSU shall become vested, and if your RSU was granted more than a year prior to your Retirement, then 100% of your RSU shall become vested 30 days after your Retirement date provided you have executed and delivered by that date a restrictive covenant and release of claims in such form as the Company may require, as may be requested by any member of the Company Group. You will receive one Share for each vested RSU, payable as soon as practicable (not more than 60 days) after such 30th day after your Retirement date, provided that payment may be delayed until six months after your Retirement date to the extent the Company determines necessary to comply with Code Section 409A."
