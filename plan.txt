1. Data Collection
   1.1. Identify and list the sources of 10-K reports (e.g., SEC EDGAR database).
   1.2. Download the 10-K reports in text format.
   1.3. Store the raw 10-K reports in a designated directory for further processing.

2. Data Preprocessing
   2.1. Read the Raw Data
       2.1.1. Use a file reader to read the raw 10-K report files.
       classes to process: Parser -> 
   2.2. Remove Metadata
       2.2.1. Strip out any metadata, headers, footers, and other non-essential information.
   2.3. Text Normalization
       2.3.1. Remove special characters and unnecessary whitespace.
       2.3.2. Convert text to lowercase.
       2.3.3. Remove stopwords.
       2.3.4. Lemmatize the text to reduce words to their base forms.

3. Data Parsing and Structuring
   3.1. Identify Sections
       3.1.1. Use regular expressions to identify and extract sections (e.g., Item 1, Item 1A).
   3.2. Map Sections to Parts
       3.2.1. Map each identified section to its corresponding part (e.g., PART 1, PART 2).
   3.3. Create Data Models
       3.3.1. Create instances of data models (e.g., Item, Part, Report10K) to represent the structured data.

4. Data Storage Preparation
   4.1. Database Setup
       4.1.1. Set up an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance.
   4.2. Schema Design
       4.2.1. Design the database schema to store the structured data.
       4.2.2. Create tables for parts, items, and reports.
   4.3. Database Connection
       4.3.1. Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using a library like psycopg2.

5. Data Insertion
   5.1. Insert Parts and Items
       5.1.1. Iterate through the structured data and insert each part and item into the corresponding database tables.
   5.2. Handle Relationships
       5.2.1. Ensure that relationships between parts and items are correctly maintained in the database.

6. Data Validation and Quality Check
   6.1. Validation Scripts
       6.1.1. Write scripts to validate the data in the database.
       6.1.2. Check for missing or incomplete data.
       6.1.3. Verify that all parts and items are correctly linked.
   6.2. Manual Review
       6.2.1. Perform a manual review of a sample of the data to ensure it meets quality standards.

7. Automation and Scheduling
   7.1. Pipeline Automation
       7.1.1. Use tools like Apache Airflow or AWS Lambda to automate the pipeline steps.
   7.2. Scheduling
       7.2.1. Schedule the pipeline to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to process new 10-K reports.

8. Monitoring and Maintenance
   8.1. Monitoring
       8.1.1. Set up monitoring to track the performance and health of the pipeline.
       8.1.2. Use AWS CloudWatch or similar tools to monitor the RDS instance.
   8.2. Error Handling
       8.2.1. Implement error handling and logging to capture and address any issues that arise.
   8.3. Maintenance
       8.3.1. Regularly update and maintain the pipeline to ensure it continues to function correctly and efficiently.
